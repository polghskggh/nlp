it is really diheartening to read about these immigrants from this article who drowned.  it makes me feel anxious and upset how the whole ordeal happened.  it is a terrible occurrence that this had to happen at the mediterranean sea.  thankfully there were some survivors.  the fact that babies were lost makes it that much more emotional to read all of this	0
it is frightening to learn about all these shark attacks but these surfers should be aware of the risks associated with the sport.  relocating the sharks should be a priority and it would be in the best interest to establish a moratorium on water sports until the shark epidemic is dealt with.  closing beach in australia is a good precautionary method	2
middle east is fucked up, I've honestly never heard of a middle east country such as Afganistan deporting people, the mention of it just sound funny, who the heck would want to stay in that shit hole country that has been infested with terrorists and child rapists? Perhaps those refugees are out of choice, honestly they should come to a better country such as U.S. or U.K, even though those 2 countries have their own policies regarding immigration, but I think they're quite tolerate to people from war torn countries	3
well first of all whoever wrote this article doesn't know how to properly divide an article into paragraphs, which made reading this article extremely painful, but nonetheless I do know after reading the article that Zika virus tend to stay in semen and vaginal fluid for extended amount of time, so it's obvious don't mate with people who have zika virus, and don't even think about having a baby, they're going to be defective	3
I thought the article was quite sad to read and disheartening to hear about the Iraqi people. I felt sad for them knowing their future was uncertain and how hard it was to find a job. The economy they deal with is much worse than ours and I can only imagine how difficult it must be living there. I hope that it gets better in the future.	0
Hearing about the violence going on over politics in the country is really sad and upsetting. It's easy to take for granted how we live and how lucky we are that we don't have to worry about people killing us on a daily basis. Our government is also democratic which means people have a voice. This isn't the case in some areas/	0
This is a crazy story with so many facets to it, omg. I mean on one hand, I don't support an eye for an eye. I don't support the death penalty and I don't support blinding someone. BUT on the other hand, this is a country where women really struggle and the justice system is not well developed. ALSO, he blinded a FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL. What the fuck is wrong with this guy. So if this was in America I would not support it, but I don't feel right condemning the actions of an entirely different country for doing what they felt needed to be done.	3
I totally support these protesters. We've had trouble with oil pipelines here in Michigan. I feel like these pipelines are foisted on local communities without any care for whether it is good for the community and without adequate studies as to how safe they are from leaks and pollution. There are more important things in life than money and oil.	4
This shooting is a good example of how black people and people w are wrongly prosecuted by the police. Now in this articles this gentlemen is getting a re-trial since they concur that he didn't do such thing and basically had the police lying to the judge. Now he can be fairly be judged and not be discriminated	4
Felt bad reading the article because tons of people are losing basically their lives. The wild fires are destroying their farm, things, and even their animals. Without all of those things they cant have a proper living through buying and selling crops or animals. I hope we can donate to an organization nor something to help them	0
I feel for her. They couldn’t afford to cremate them on their own and help them, and the financial help they were entitled to as crime victims had not come through because the system today isn't going to help criminals. I hope the government now helps criminals through dangerous activities and make the world a better place	0
I wish there was something more that I could do. This is getting out of hand, but it's kind of far away geographically from us. There needs to be something the international community can do. Farmers everywhere are killing pests and animals that interfere with their farms, but elephants are completely different from pests. They are extremely smart and are just hungry. I honestly wonder if we should come up with a plan to feed them, and this might sound crazy, but try to study elephants and come up with some way to communicate abstract ideas with them.	6
Climate change is extremely worrisome. And it is getting worse and worse every year. Something has to be done about it, and I think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying. The world is dying and I think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible. Too many CEO's are thinking about their own profits. The system needs to limit their power and start focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead.	2
It's shocking how little people care about this and how little Africa gets mentioned in the news. This is horrific when you think about the number of victims and the people who are harmed. I wish people could focus on this. It's ridiculous that people are getting away with this and it is a huge crisis on the level of other genocides in history.	5
Reading about issues happening across the world seems foreign, but just think: any trouble anywhere in the world, the US is usually involved. I think any conflict and abuses of power in any nation in the world, especially in the middle east, can spell disaster for the people in the US. We can't really ignore issues that happen far away because ultimately as a nation, we will have to face the consequences, either by sending our troops or  any other effects.	0
How disgusting is Wells Fargo? It's unbelievable the way they treated their tellers, and all those fake accounts? Can you even? I don't understand how this bank doesn't get shut down. You really should think about getting an account with a different bank, you know. What if your SS got used to make some of those accounts?	3
That's incredibly disgusting. I feel like it should count as a hate crime, and everyone on that boat who had anything to do with that incident should be brought before a judge and made to answer for their involvement. I really hope the LGBT community organizes some kind of boycott; Royal Caribbean should be made to feel financial pain for their negligence	4
This is terrible, but what I find hard to believe is that there are still that many Yahoo accounts in the world that aren't spambots. Or some other kind of bots. Anyway, aren't you glad I got you on gmail? I'm glad I shut my yahoo account down a long time ago. You should probably do that, if you haven't, just for safety's sake.	3
I just read an article about America's refugee problem, that talked about the Somali community in Minneapolis. I can't believe the emotional language they tried to use in the article; it just makes me sick to see any reporting that doesn't only concern the facts, with no editorializing by the author. I wish that everyone who decided to become a writer would learn that there is no place for opinion in the news.	0
I had heard about the huge fires burning in the Indonesia area and the haze clouds they are producing but I didn't realize it was so bad. Apparently there is a statistical study that says 100,000 people have been killed by this. The researchers tried to count "early deaths" and got that figure. I suspect the root problem is corruption. Some of the business owners in Indonesia and Malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity, even though their actions cause great harm to the environment and to humans near and far. Maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths. On the other hand I dislike the idea of people being convicted of crimes via statistical analysis. It is too easy to manipulate.	5
The whole "police violence against blacks" theme has been overplayed to manipulate people. The fact is that there really is a problem of police feeling justified in shooting people whenever they feel threatened, but this doesn't just happen to blacks. I can think of four cases off the top of my head where innocent unarmed white men were killed by police. One of them was the recent case where the guy who died was the victim of "swatting". He wasn't involved in an crime at all, but the police burst into his house with guns blazing and he died. And the cop won't be prosecuted. I hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will join forces with others who don't want to live in a police state.	3
Apparently there are now a lot of wildfires in the Appalachia area, and it seems people are going to try to spin this into a "climate change" story. It seems that every single negative event can be attributed to climate change. The media doesn't even try to make an argument, it just inserts insinuations. I used to believe that global warming was a deadly threat to humanity, but if you look into things, there are many extremely dubious elements to the "official" story, and now I don't know what to think.  Even if the official story is true, it is obvious that the issue is being routinely used for political purposes. And I don't know if it is true. Why has a vast swath of temperature readings been "corrected"? Most people don't even know about this issue.	0
Again it's all about the money. Corporate America strikes again. They leech as much money from the working class as possible as they sit in their office, finger banging their secretary. When their lies and misdirection is revealed, some fat cat takes the blame (along with millions of dollars of hush money, and the working class is thrown to the wolves and blamed for most of the misdeeds.	3
Can you believe what this family has done to these girls?  They have treated these children so heinously.  It is insane that the police wouldn't do anything until they were basically forced by the media.  I can appreciate things that happened later to help these girls but this so unfair.  This breaks my heart.	0
Poor woman!  I hope that she is able to recover.  I hate to hear of anyone being in an accident.  I see that there were three cars involved.  I wonder if she was the other one critically injured.  I guess if there were were at least three people involved and only one was seriously injured, those aren't the worst odds.	0
So i just read this article on gold fish in the wild.  Wow. I learned a lot.  Apparently we have an overload of gold fish in our lakes and rivers, which is very bad for the fish and the earth.  It's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they swim low on the bottom.  It is also bad for the fish because they aren't bread for the big waters.  their bodies grow as big as a football and they can weigh up to 4 pounds.  Some are not even healthy.  They say the best way to get rid of healthy fish is to bring it back to the pet store and to not flush sick or dead fish.  put them in an ice slush. this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same time.	0
So today i read about Vaughn, an actor I didn't really know his name but have watched or heard most of the shows and movies he has been in.  Today, i heard, he died at age 83 due to lukemia.  IT is very sad to lose such a well respected actor.  I guess his parents divorced at a young age but both gave him the genes to act.	0
It's such a shame that so much violence takes place over there each year. You'd think all the different factions would finally agree to disagree and move on but instead they just seem to want to keep killing. I understand why since so many different groups want to destroy the other side leaving smaller nations like Yemen to have to defend themselves since the other factions seem to be unable to leave in peace.	0
I can't imagine what it must have been like for the people who were caught up in this, how helpless they must have felt. Not having any recourse for so long, no one doing anything to right the wrongs, just feeling like it's ok for you to be abused and for it to go on for so long and happen to so many people. Maybe they feel some kind of closure now though.	0
It may make me sound horrible, but I'm torn on this. No one should have to suffer like that for the crime of theft, it's barbaric, but if it really was a twenty-something that was part of an armed gang, I'm slightly less sympathetic about their victims retaliating. If it was a child, however, this is insanity and just horrifying.	0
To be honest with you, In my opinion, I do not believe Russia or Syria are peaceful countries. Syria has the most corrupt and dishonest government officials in the world, and the fact that Russia has defended them through everything is very disturbing and alarming. I know we all like to think that Trump and Putin are in "bed" together, but is that really the case? What Syria does to its own people goes beyond what words can describe, and how Russia can defend these actions is almost as equally disgusting.	4
Awful news article. Us as a society need to do a better job of protecting and helping not only our planet, but the animals and mammals that surround it. The fact that almost 100 percent of the caimans are suspected to be dead is alarming and people should be more informed on such matters. The rate of extinction that these animals and mammals are going through on our planet is extremely alarming and I can not figure out why people aren't more concerned or even aware of the matter. We need to do a better job of protecting ALL living matter on this planet, not just ourselves.	2
I feel that these Muslim areas are in dire need of help. I feel so very sad and alarmed for them, as I know the citizens are helpless and don't know who to turn to for help. It can't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided, your women being raped and worry of your child being dragged into Military or political rebels groups. Many people in America do not realize how much freedom, safety and peace we have by living in this country, as we have never experienced the peril that people in these Muslim countries experience. I'm sure many live in terror and fear of the unknown, of what could be, and actually the reality of their life. There are many poor villages and citizens, so they don't have options to find a way out of there.	0
Venezuela and many of it's sister countries are going through a crisis. Due to drops in oil prices, and the loss of income the country has received from this drop, the citizens are the ones that are paying for it. They are hungry, there is issues with people not having enough food and starving. Their political powers are corrupt and can't be counted on for help. There is fighting, rebels and rampant crime. My heart breaks for this people, as they don't have anyone to turn to for help. They feel powerless, hungry and scared.	0
As a woman myself, I really sympathize with these women. While I find it very difficult to imagine what they go through as a woman, I can get some vague idea. I would hate to think that I had to have a male escort when I left my home. They aren't treated as equals, and often men don't even consider them equal as their family pet! &lt;Many of the women can be abused, physically and sexually, and they are considered to be the problem, not the abuser! I hope they are able to win by the petition, and will be able to have a bit more freedom!	0
There was a terrible bus crash near the town where I grew up.  It looks like a black sedan hit the bus and people were hurt.  Apparently the injured people were taken to a nearby hospital where I used to work.  No word was released on the condition of the individuals but I sure hope it was no one we know or that no one is seriously hurt.  Please say a prayer for all involved and be grateful that no lives were lost.	0
Again, I wouldn't share this with anyone; it's not that interesting to me or to the people that I know. Have you seen this article about the sudden rise in tiger murders by poachers? It's pretty shitty that this still goes on, but what can you do? People are going to be horrible for all kinds of reasons and nothing is going to change. What do you think about it? Did you think that this was an interesting article? What's your thoughts?	5
Hey, here's another article that I'm sending to you for no good reason, since neither of us are interested in this kind of thing. It looks like more people died for shitty reasons, but maybe some are still alive. And, if there's anything that people love, it's the idea that things can be ok and / or get better. People fucking love this stuff. But, I did think that the bit about a HEN being rescued was out of place. haha. So, what do you think?	6
Hi can you believe this? We have to be very careful with this. You never know what kind of damage you can receive in your eyes from having these infections. I would never want to this to happen to me or my daughter. I will have to really take care of my our lenses from now and on to prevent any damage.	2
Hey friend did you check out this article. We should do our best to protect ourselves and our loved ones from Zika. I know that when my wife was pregnant I paid close attention to the news in order to be up to date with developments. It is really sad to see children being born with microphely. I really hope something will be done.	0
I really hate ISIS. They continue to be the stain on society by committing atrocities condemned by every nation in the world. They must be stopped at all costs and they must be destroyed so that they wont hurt another soul. These poor people who are trying to survive get killed, imprisoned, or brainwashed into joining and there seems to be no way to stop them.	3
The pipeline seems to be interfering with native american tribes and is causing lots of enviornmental damage. I do feel for these individuals, and it's important they get all the help they deserve. Their anscestors were decimated throughout history and there isnt enough reparations to solve the genocide that was caused.	0
Take a look at this story about a forest being decimated and what is happening to the monkeys there.  So sad.  Think you would be interested in reading it.  The government is doing nothing to stop the deforestation or anything to protect the monkeys.   I know that it is not local to us, but still a sad thing to read about.	0
Take a look at this story that I found online.  It's about forest fires being spread out over a couple of different states, pretty interesting.  I know that I sent you the pictures of what was happening around here, but you might be also interested in reading this story about how it is happening all over the place.	1
Remember that you where telling me about how you were having trouble sleeping lately?  Maybe you should take a look at this article that I found online about sleep paralysis and what it is all about and how it is affecting this guy.  I hope that it can help you out a little bit with what you have been going through.	1
I feel like entraprenerurship is the future. Apparently they are making it so you can quit your job and get unemployment benefits. It's pretty awesome. I guess they want to encourage people to start unique businesses on their own in an effort to diversify the workfroce in the country. Pretty cool if you ask me.	6
I feel like our police force is getting kinda out of control with its killings recently. It's all i seem to hear about on the news nowadays. They recently charged an officer who shot an unarmed black driver when he was outside his vehicle.It's like the police don't even care anymore which is really scary.	2
This is disgusting. As many of you know, I am an animal lover. There is not much that makes me sad, upset and angry like any instance of an animal suffering. What this man did is unforgivable. I hope he has a mental illness. I cannot think of any other reason why someone would do something so cruel.	4
i think we all need to do a better job of taking care of are forest and water ways because we rely on these to surive and if we are killing animals and fish the wrong way and they start to go away it could have a big impact on us and by that time it could be to late to do anything about it. so we need to put laws in that will help the animals but also help allow us to fish for them the right way not by taking a shortcut	1
My heart hurts for those affected. I will be praying for the soldiers attacked and their families. As we approach memorial day, we need to reflect on what we have learned in past wars and one thing is clear, mustard gas is not a weapon that should be used, I understand that many of the attacks going on right now include Guerrilla warfare but we cannot fight back in the same ways.	0
It's a shame that we're seeing this sort of rise in violence. It's not shock that after years of the right bullying the left into tolerating intolerance that we've come to this point. People aren't even trying to hide their racism anymore, and they're intentionally making shit worse to justify their oppressive agendas.	3
hello andrea I know it's only been 2 weeks since you went to japan but I hope it's good for you and that especially be very careful remember that it's a different country with a different ethnicity things are very different there I hope you take care of everything since There's a lot of prostitution away from the evils and you'll be a good friend until later	2
hello brother I am learning the news I am very happy that you are already in sacrament I am happy that after completing your dream of playing in the NBA is a great time for you and you should know how to take advantage of this great opportunity take care of yourself and succeed.I'm really very proud of you	6
hello brother I hope you are well these days and thought a lot about you and more when I see the news I find out that Saudi Arabia is struggling to expand its territory no matter what this pado should take care of being there is very dangerous so be careful I hope you take care of yourself and think of us	2
Man veterans need more help. This article talks about how a lot of Americans have problems, especially vets, with sleeping. I can imagine that this sleeping problem can carry over into so many other areas of their lives like at work and their interpersonal relationships. Even thought they weren't able to establish a specific link their has to be a link between PTSD and problems with sleeping given the huge consequences of PTSD.	1
This is a nice story - people have some level of need to protect nature and protecting birds is an excellent way of giving back, especiailly since some are endangered. I have to commend this person for trying really hard to protect one species, and for committing to it. I myself would have a difficult time choosing what to hel pwith - but this person doesnt!	6
These are the headlines that I have to read these days! I just can't believe all of the horrid news that is taking over our lives lately. And now we have to worry about when our men and women go out to train, that this kind of thing can end of happening at the drop of a hat. So, who is responsible after this? Who helps the children now without parents? Who pays for everything surrounding their funerals, and all of the costs after that?	0
A bus driver, going about doing his business, supporting the community, has had his life taken from him in what is a senseless and needless act." Taxi driver Aguek Nyok helped passengers escape. He was in the area meaning to get a haircut and kicked the bus door three times before managing to break it open. "All the people were at the back trying to get out of the bus but they couldn't get out the front because of the flames," he told the Courier-Mail newspaper. "They couldn't open the back door so I kicked it down and they all came running out. "It was one of the two: you get the people out or they're going to die." Mr Nyok said there were three children among the passengers. Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk said it was "a very, very sad day for the council and the wider community". Flags	0
Tensing was later fired. Tensing, 26, testified he feared he was going to be killed. Prosecutors said repeatedly the evidence contradicted Tensing’s story. Judge Megan Shanahan said Saturday that the jury of 10 whites and two blacks spent more two hours deliberating Saturday morning after getting a night’s sleep and still could not reach a decision. “It’s obvious to me you have made a sincere and conscientious effort,” the judge said before setting a new hearing date for Nov. 28 to determine whether the case will re-tried. County prosecutor Joe Deters said he’ll decide within the next two weeks whether to try the case again. Attorney Al Gerhardstein, who represents the DuBose family, said they want another trial and can’t understand why the jury couldn’t reach a conclusion. “With the video	1
I am one for not giving your potential mate any reasonable doubt. For example if Tanaka (Mariah Carey's backup dancer) made her fiance uncomfortable he should have been axed in the beginning of the relationship. I also do not think it supports security all the time either. I think that if you  value that mate there should definitely be sacrifices made in regards with relationships.	1
There are many orphaned children around the world. International displacement is a huge problem that seems to be causing a lot of separated families. These children are having to go to orphanages, shelters, and other temporary placement in order to seek refuge. These children range in age from young to teenagers.	0
Details and information about the past is used to make decisions, as past experiences of feelings influence current decision-making, how people will feel in the future, and if they want to feel that way again. Gilbert and Wilson conducted a study to show how pleased a person would feel if they purchased flowers for themselves for no specific reason (birthday, anniversary, or promotion etc.) and how long they thought that feeling would last. People who had no experience of purchasing flowers for themselves and those who had experienced buying flowers for themselves were tested. Results showed that those who had purchased flowers in the past for themselves felt happier and that feeling lasted longer for them than for a person who had never experienced purchasing flowers for themselves	1
Erving Goffman, a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how the emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside. Goffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an ongoing thing that an individual is consciously and actively working through. Individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings.	1
According to a new study, the polar regions are continuing to melt. In a decade, a lot of the ice melted. This situation is really affecting polar bears because they live in that environment. I found out that they ambush seals as they come up out of the water. Whether we can change this trend or not, I am not sure about but we should try.	1
A reward of $25000 is being offered to catch somebody who is killing horses in the Salt River area. There are several murders of horses every year. Anyways, the group raising the money started a campaign on GoFundMe, and people have donated $25000. The group also is concerned with conservation-related issues.	1
I saw some heartbreaking news and I could not believe it. Why would defenseless and innocent people be killed over something that they did not do or had no involvement with? I will never understand why some things in this world are the way that they are. There needs to be change but sadly I do not think we will see it soon.	0
I'm not sure how to feel about animals that are considered as abused when being used for entertainment purposes. It gives us the opportunity to learn and see them up close but at the same time its hard to handle the fact that these animals might be feeling pain. I mean imagine being captive by monkeys your whole life so they can introduce them to humans. Would be sad.	0
I just read an article about Kesha and how she was pressured into losing weight by not eating and "dumbing down" the content of her songs. It's pretty messed up that this is what goes on in the entertainment/music industry. At the same time though, she is an adult and she had the choice to go along with this or not. She cashed in and got a lot of fame. I can't say I really feel that sorry for her. If it was me I would have just said, "no" and moved on. She had the ability to speak up, but she didn't because she wanted fame.	0
I just read an article that outlines what Obama did to help the "poor" compared to what Trump wants to do to take these things away. Obviously, the poor are going to have a much harder time under Trump's administration. I think it goes without saying that I hate this guy and I can't believe he is our president. I am counting the days til the next presidential election. If these idiots vote for him again, well, I won't believe it. Although, I didn't believe he would be voted in in the first place either. It is just sad that our country is taking ten steps way way back voting in this guy.	3
Victim Amanda divulged her horrific experience, including her parents making her pose for explicit photographs and videotaping their sexual encounters with a view to sell them online.f I could take it all back I would. I hate myself for what I did," she added, along with claims that Amanda's father made her "join him" in abusing their daughter. She suggested it was all her then-husband's idea and that she had initially fought him for three months, but eventually "gave in".	0
this is an incredibly one sided article.  not sure how they are even allowed to publish stuff like this.  It is amazing they had to reference black lives matter, and all of sudden this guy was an upstanding citizen.  There is always a reason an office pulls the trigger.  Sometimes, it is an accident, but more often that not, it is not.  Hopefully they will publish the toxicology report. Won't hold my breath though.	4
Clearly, this was an opinion piece.  It is upsetting that so many try to pass off an opinion piece as a news article these days.  That is exactly what fake news is.  The writer wasn't even trying to hide it.  She included "hhhhhhmmmmmmm,  hhhmmmm,  hhhmmmm" as part of her article.  LMFAO.  That is when there was not longer any reason to take it seriously anymore.  Sure, some of the info in there may be accurate, but the bias overwhelms all.	4
This article says that, A deeper look inside Wells Fargo's shameful vault — People my kids' age, who track their money by smartphone, wonder why garish competing bank branches still stud every shopping district in Philadelphia and the suburbs. Now we know: Behind the lollipops and the barred cages where the tellers sit, perverse incentives at many banks turn branches into, not just stores, but sweatshops, pushing products customers don't need and may not have ordered, thanks to admissions by Wells Fargo Bank, the dominant lender around Philadelphia, and veteran bankers. Facing outrage, Wells Fargo has belatedly stalled tens of millions of dollars in stock awards to two top executives after admitting it fired 5,300 low-paid workers over five years for opening phony accounts.	4
hello friend, how have you been lately, I am somewhat depressed by an article that I read recently, that helped me a lot, that I realized that the article had a problem that interested me more, because of the events that were happening in this, for example: He did not vaccinate or treat his cattle due to illness; he does not use cowboys to control them and cope; does not manage or control the reproduction	0
The Girl with the beautiful green eyes that was pictured years ago by a photographer is currently under arrest for falsifying documents to stay in pakistan. I feel bad for this woman who felt a need to lie about her status of citizenship to stay in a country just to continue living a better life.  This is the second time she has been arrested which shows me that she is really trying to escape a war ravaged country and to continue on living a better life. They should let the girl go.  Good for the original photographer who is trying to help her out of this situation.	0
This article was just ridiculous to me, I see the need to be protesting and freedom of speech and rights but we as people need to do peaceful protest not using armed militias to stand off on a protest. That is going against the very fundamentals of what liberals stand for. I think the group should have had some repercussions to what they did.	3
I am torn when it comes to this one. I feel bad because that is a horrible way to die and his sister definitely did not need to see that.  But I also do not understand why they would be so careless and wander off on a trail where it is clearly marked that they shouldnt be leaving.  If they would have paid more attention and didnt carelessly not listen to rules than this situation could have been avoided.	0
This is terrible and really solidifies everything I feel about the racially tense issues going on in america right now that are just fueled by our current president. No one should ever have to be a victim of a senseless act only because of the type of person they are. We are all equal no matter our religion race anything. We need to really open our eyes up and realize there needs to be more love in the world.	0
I think it's hard to determine things like this unless the entire program in each community is being monitored. If not, the money spent versus the number of children being taught or learning from this process is hard to determine. I do think that connecting the schools is important though and that children should be learning computers, but by the time they're in the workplace, the jobs may have changed.	1
I think China has a real problem with safety standards and that's why they have so many accidents in their various industries. It's really sad that they place economic growth over human lives. If they did implement safety standards, they wouldn't lose so many lives or potential workers and people that care for children.	0
My amazement with the acts of random humans never ceases.  I often question how it is that I, another random human in this mixed up shit-hole we call "Planet Earth", can have unlimited empathy (to the level that I won't even squash a bug) and other people will go out of their way to run over an animal crossing the road. Humans can be rather sadistic and disgusting individuals.  Every single day of my life I hear of some crazy story about someone beating something to death.	4
Dude, there is some pretty messed up stuff going on. I feel like every time I turn on the news or open a newspaper I am reading about pedophilia going on all over the world. I feel like it is much more common than anyone realizes and that at any given moment, I could be walking past someone who is sexually attracted to children. It is crazy to think about and really scary.	2
I just read about a group of people that were celebrating Halloween and got hit by a car. It makes me wonder how people can be so irresponsible with children. They were riding on the back of a trailer when they got hit by another car. That is so unsafe. I wouldn't even want to do that with other adults, let alone children.	3
I just read an article about women encouraging other women to get IUD's before Trump took office. They were worried that trump in office will restrict women's access to affordable birth control. They think because the IUD can last for so long that women should get them in soon. I don't think these women need to be out getting IUD's, there are other ways to prevent pregnancy. If they are really concerned, condoms work well.	2
This guy got fucked. It sucks for him, but there’s nothing you can really do about these things, besides deal with it. There’s always going to be inefficiency and points of failure in any bureaucratic system right? Maybe the cops will get their shit together and sort it out for him, before he has to jump through all the bureaucratic hoops because of their initial mistake.	3
Dear friend,  I have just finished reading a very interesting and somewhat disturbing article. It was about Thomas Arthur, an inmate on death row in Alabama. There began a massive legal battle between the courts, justices, and lawyers about the legality and morality of lethal injection practices. I feel conflicted because on one hand, these people committed unthinkable crimes and deserve severe punishment, but on the other hand, taking a life may still not be justifiable.	0
We need to be more considerate of climate change, its effects are too dangerous to ignore. Because of this, it's easy to recognize the moral imperative we have to fulfill our obligations to society. We would be remiss to deny these exact warning signs, and we know that scientists have dedicated their entire lives towards the subject of climate change. We should heed their collective warning immediately.	1
Everything from the smoking dangers posed to children, to the epidemic of rats and their waste products, to even refugee crises surrounding Greece - are all problematic situations. These situations have to each be approached from a different perspective, and because of this - they require a more focused and specialized touch.	1
It's horrifying to see a dog subjected to such a cruel fate. This brings attention to the numerous other cases of fatalism that could've been prevented by careful inspection and care for one's pets. Dogs deserve better from us, and it's our obligation as human beings to provide care for animals as much as possible.	0
Just because someone happens to be a celebrity doesn't mean that their suffering is any less valid than the average person's. We should learn to recognize that as a society, we must come to understand the universal nature of suffering as applicable to all people. One's status in life should not leave them any more open to suffering than others.	0
For days, a hazy pall has spread across much of northern Georgia, including metro Atlanta, home to 5.7 million people. State officials warned that the air is unhealthy, and cautioned people with breathing problems to stay indoors as much as possible. With state firefighters scrambling to quench the blazes currently active, officials told people to avoid starting new fires that could quickly spread. “We’re a cigar butt away from a disaster,” said John Williams, adventure guide at Amicalola Falls, a state park near the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail in Georgia	0
Look at this nonsense.  We can put dudes on the moon and videochat across the planet with anyone we like, but we STILL can't make containers for fuel that don't leak everywhere? You know that "Cui bono" thing I told you about? At this point I think someone (probably the environazis) benefit from this enough to keep doing it. How about we build pipelines for the oil?  Oh right, environazis again, complete with the trash heap they left behind after their protest.	5
I don't really feel much of anything when I read about this sort of incident since it happens all the time, I guess if I had to come up with something I would say I feel vaguely annoyed and irritated, I don't see why people can't manage to watch sports games in an orderly, non-violent manner, so the fact that we have to deal with this nonsense every time a popular sporting event happens is irritating. I think that it should not be difficult for people to conduct themselves appropriately, so it is frustrating that this sort of thing happens so often during sporting and other events.	3
I feel sorry for this person's family. His children now have no father. You just never know what makes people commit terrible acts of evil. Life can be taken in the blink of an eye. You need to make sure all your loved ones know how much you care, do as much good in the world as you can, because you never know when your last day on this earth is going to be.	0
I think the wraparound glasses are a great idea. I don't care how ridiculous they look. If I had to choose whether or not my kid was worried about fashion or protecting his eyes, eye protection would win every time. Ugh, can you imagine the possibility of losing your eyesight, or possibly even the whole eye, just because you didn't want to look silly? Nope, wraparound glasses all the way!	6
The earthquake was terrible. Thankfully, they didn't have injured people, just frightened ones. As bad as the situation is, it could have been worse. While people have no homes, they have their lives and the lives of their loved ones. It is terrible these people don't have a particularly safe place to stay right now, and the thought of losing everything you own is catastrophic. But, you can rebuild your life with your family.	2
It's sad the train wreck cost 4 people their lives. One can only hope none of the injured are critical. It would be great if they could find the cause of the accident. If they don't, who's to say it won't happen again? The statistics could be even worse next time. Wish this could have been prevented.	0
All of you know that I love birds. This article was hard for me to read because of that. Wind turbines are killing a lot of birds, including eagles. It's really very sad. It makes me feel awful. I am all for wind turbines and renewable sources of energy because of global warming and coal, but this is awful. I don't want these poor birds to die like this. Read this article and you'll see why.	0
The tweets attacked her personally, she explained in a blog post on Thursday, and celebrated the end of “Mockingbird.” “Mockingbird is canceled,” Cain had tweeted early last week. “But we need to make sure @Marvel makes room for more titles by women about women kicking ass.” She also tweeted out the cover of the last “Mockingbird” issue and encouraged followers to buy that issue and “send a message to @marvel that there’s room in comics for super her stories about grown-up women.	1
Thomas referred the case to the full court, and shortly before midnight, the justices issued an order granting Arthur’s stay request. The order included a statement from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. explaining that while he did not believe this case merited a review from the Supreme Court, he had decided to vote for a stay anyway as a courtesy to his colleagues. Roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution. While it takes five justices to overturn a lower court ruling, it takes only four to accept a case. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy,” he wrote. Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito would have rejected the requ	1
I certainly feel bad for people having to live in such horrible conditions. However, I also feel bad for the regions that these refugees are going to. It has to be a huge strain on these countries to accept large numbers of homeless that will just depress their economy. It is a tough situation and I can see both sides of it.	0
I can not blame people for leaving. Living in an area that is prone to natural disasters, like an area that is below sea level and near a coast, is a bad idea. It is bad for the government of Louisiana, but you can't blame these people for getting out. And, of course, there is nothing that they can do to stop them.	3
Hello friend,  This article cracks me up. As someone who hates Trump, I think it's hilarious. Realistically, the mother should've just talked to her son about the reasons she dislikes Trump. Trying to convince him that Trump is a immoral person would've been a better use of her time. What makes me mad though, is that people called CPS on her. People always trying to get involved in everybody's business.	3
I like Lena Heady, and, even though she plays one of the worst mother's on television, I can imagine that she must be a ball of nerves over this custody dispute.  I can;t imagine having to go through this, especially since the custody seemed to be agreed upon.  Her ex husband doesn't seem to be thinking about Wylie's best interest - only his own.  If it were me, I'd fight tooth and nail to kepp my son in the same country as me.	6
There are immigrants in this country that are having a hard time assimilation in to the American Culture. The article blames Trump I believe there are most things at work here than just him. It seems the system is working as intended and it was in place before Trump. People need to be able to assimilate as it keeps our country at peace. What do you think we should do about it?	5
Those poor families in the Middle East. Near the city of Yemen. I guess so much fighting over there has led to really unhealthy living conditions. They are having new suspected cases of cholera all the time, and most of those ill are young kids. I can't even imagine such bad living conditions. These kids deserve a better life. Not fear and illness.	0
This is a completely unacceptable situation. Our military bombs a Doctors Without Borders medical facility and they have the gall to point their fingers at those who were bombed. And the only restitution they offer is a promise to keep bombing and carrying on just like they were until the mission is completed. Revolting.	3
Seems like a pretty ordinary occurrence. I'm sure their families are upset but I'm less sure this kind of story deserves space in a newspaper. A couple people got sick and they died. Anyway, it's a mildly sad story but it's not noteworthy or newsworthy. I don't understand why stories like this run in the paper.	0
I have a lot of sympathy for everyone worried about the Trump administration. I get it. They're not wrong to be worried. I think the author of this article misidentifies the source of the problem, though. It's not Trump. Trump himself isn't why we're in this situation. It's the people and institutions who supported him and the people and institutions who were ineffective at combating him that deserve the lion's share of the blame.	3
The whole situation with Iraq and the uprising of ISIS can be attributed to the U.S. War on Terror and failed attempts at establishing democracy in the Middle East. The truth of the matter is, the G.W. Bush  administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade Iraq under the pretense of ridding Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction: Iraq had none, and we destroyed the Iraqi way of life over this lie. Iraqis may have suffered under Saddam Hussein, but at the very least, the region was stable and extremists were rare. After the American invasion, civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because law and order were thrown out as well.	4
The article was about corruption at the International Monetary Fund, specifically the wrongdoing of former boss Rodrigo Rato. The banking industry is rife with issues like this, so it comes as no surprise that someone was trying to take advantage of the system even in an international organization like the IMF. The problem is that we do not have enough prosecutors that are willing to take on the banking industry and put them in their place. I'm tired of constantly hearing about people getting away with white collar crimes.	4
I felt that reading the excerpt from the article was sad and had me feeling distraught to an extent. I know it's just an article but hearing about all the bad in the world is just an assured way to get a poor start to the day. I was mostly wondering what the situation was where Richard Hong was killed in the Los Angeles home. Whos home was it and why was George Stroumbolopoulos there. I'd like to know the more intricate details of what went down in this crime. Was it a murder of passion or was it cold blooded. Was it in the moment or was it calculated. What will happen now, hopefully and investigation can uncover this.	0
This article about a firecracker going off during a protest is about the stupidest thing I have seen in a while. The journalists are pond scum trying desperately to write anything they can to divide people up. College kids can't bear a firecracker going off, they need to institute mandatory military service like Israel does, then maybe they would not be scared chickens crying about everything.	2
Another doom and gloom article about Trump. Not surprising, ethics and truth passed out of journalism long ago. Trump is not against renewable power, he just wants a free market and he is right. The free market is the only way you will get renewables to the efficiency that they need to go global and push carbon out. If you coddle them they will get fat and lazy and never move forward. The Paris treaty was a push toward globalism and a boon for the liberals who dream of an elite class ruling the world.	4
Passing this article along to you because I know you will think this is absurd. Gay men are not being allowed to donate blood to the victims of the Pulse Nightclub shooting. Isn't that crazy! Apparently, outdated rules put them at high risk for HIV and they can not donate for fear of spreading HIV. This is super discriminatory as HIV is not just found in gay men. People instead should be appropriately tested for HIV.	2
Passing this article along to you! Remember how we were just discussing this? I guess there is enough doubt now in the death of the Polish former president that died in that plane crash that they now are exhuming the body. Some people suspect that the Russians actually poisoned him and the crash is a cover up! Not everyone's happy about this though as it might seem disrespectful.	5
More trouble at the North Dakota pipeline protests! They have brought in riot police who are trying to break up the protestors. It looks like they are using rubber bullets and arresting a lot of people. It is scary that we can not peacefully protest in this country without fear of injury or arrest. I hope everyone is okay.	2
I cannot believe that this happened.  I feel so bad for her!  Can you believe she received threats on twitter?  It is cyber bullying for sure.  I cannt imagine this happening to me, how scary!  I am so sad that she had to cancel her account because of crazy people.  Ughhh!  I hope that these bullies are caught and she can go back to her account.	0
Can you believe this happened?  Ughh.  How scary!  I realize that people can be angry with each other, but pushing someone in front of a train??? It is amazing to me that people are so out of control that they can't even handle a verbal dispute with someone.  Its easy, just walk away!  I guess I should stay away from the train platform	5
Please hug your loved ones because they may be gone at any moments of time. If you were in an argument with any of them please reconsider what has happened in the past and let it go. Life is short and we all have only one life to live on this planet. We should all cherish each other and enjoy life to the fullest.	6
We should cherish all the works that the police force offers to us each and every day. While we sleep at night, police officers patrol up and down our streets and neighborhoods making sure that we are safe and sound. We may fear police officers when we see them but fear not because they serve the country as our law and enforcement.	6
I had never heard of people shaming women who give birth by C section. This is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. I'm sure the majority of C sections are medically required to help the mother and the baby, not because women are just so eager to undergo major surgery. Why do people even care if someone gave birth by C section instead of natural birth anyway.	3
Trump should really not underestimate the blacks. They got complacent after two Obama terms, and didn't come out in force like they should have for the election. Now that Trump is in office, I don't think there's any way he can win the black vote, and that would definitely sway the election in 2020. I really think Trump's days are numbered, whether it's impeachment or defeat in the next election.	1
Seriously, what's wrong with this guy! Who throws an animal to the ground for no reason.  What a jerk. I hope the judge throws the book at him. He doesn't necessarily deserve jail time, but I'm thinking a hefty fine as well as many hours of community service.  Sea World should file a restraining order from this guy as well.	3
Whenever kids are involved in a nasty breakup there are never any winners. The person who gets the short end of the stick in this case will probably be the child who will be forced to split time and maybe even countries between the two parents. People should try and consider the child's feelings before using them as pawns in a custody fight.	3
I think it is a shame that people still lose their lives on trails. Some do not appreciate the dangers of mother nature and try to best her without realizing what they are up against. It is always important to prepare before you go out on a hike. Without understanding what you are doing, a person could easily end up lost or dead.	0
I am very concerned about the spread of Zika. I think in many cases the federal government takes it too likely. What price is too expensive for the health and safety of our citizens, especially our most vulnerable ones. Given the advance warning we’ve had about the dangers and progression of Zika, it is shameful the lack of progress that has been made globally.	2
I think it is important to ensure safe drivers on our roads, for our family’s sake. I believe that the rate of accidents on American roads is far higher than acceptable. I believe there should be more restrictive driving requirements and testing, as well as harsher punishments for drivers who do not respect the riles of the road.	3
I think it is exciting to learn about new ways to save money in my day to day life. I am thrilled to learn that there is a potentially far more cost effective way for me to live each day, which will put me on my way towards making my dreams come true. I am intrigued by the service and I can’t wait to sink my teeth into something that could be of great service down the road.	6
This type of thing is always largely ignored as it goes on, when people could have known about it but chose not to. Then many years later the truth comes out and some people address it with discomfort, and others still continue to ignore it. The way for real change to come is with accountability. Any crimes that aren't protected by a statue of limitations need to be addressed through prosecution, and they need to look for ways to prosecute instead of looking for ways not to. They should also encourage civil suits, but those are always against the departments and not the individuals. There needs to be reform so that the officers are the ones that are held accountable instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the police broke the law.	3
It's good that they didn't have to hurt the emu. Every time I hear about one of these animal escapes I get the feeling that someone is going to end up killing the animal; I expect either an officer with legal authority or some stupid maniac with a gun who wants to kill something exotic is going to end up shooting it. I thought I saw a wild bird like run across the road one morning when I was driving to work. It wasn't big enough to be an emu but it was similar. I was worried that someone was going to kill it, whatever it was.	2
I thought that this article was something very hurtful to read. I was reading about the fire and what happened to the place that these people live and it said that these people got hurt and injured and I felt very bad for them. I wish that there was a way that everyone could help along to. The people should be more careful about the fire and see the safety next time.	0
These type of events of bomb explosions and terrorist threats are extremely dangerous and should be taken very seriously. People are just going around for their day and they don't really know what could happen to them and these type of incidents are very tragic and hurtful. The security measures in the United States should be more careful and should check anyone that is suspicious and make the country a safer place than how it already is.	2
Non-human animals are given rights only because of their interactions with human beings. Without involvement with humans, animals do not deserve rights. It is through this interaction with humans that animals are even given moral consideration. As the outcome, animals are becoming even further tarred in society. Humans have and are continuing to handle animals as if they are some kind of material goods. This is considered as being immoral, as animals have their own lives, and they think, have feelings, can feel pain, require love, happiness, and everything else that humans have. As for human rights, it’s always uncertain.	1
This is the type of thing that really scares me.  I would be very interested in viewing this video.  How in the world does one shoot their own relatives and two police officers? What gives this person the right to take someone else life? Those people may have had children, mothers, sisters, friends, co-workers, and now they are dead, and for what?  How did this individual go so long without being apprehended.  Sometimes the system really confuses me and upsets me.  I wish they would have caught him sooner and kept him alive so he could explain his actions.	2
I don't think that it is fair to compare President Trump to Nazi Germany or the holocaust.  I am not a fan of President Trump by any means, but I also have not once thought about comparing him to such a horrific part of the history of this world.  Jews should not be worried that there will be another holocaust or that they will have to go back into concentration camps.  I don't think the country would ever let that happen again, and I don't think that Donald Trump would go down that road either. He has a tendency to act like a child, but that would be a far stretch, even for him.	3
this is all about politics it talks about the like of Janet Reno, first female US attorney general who dies at 78 — anet Reno, former US attorney general under President Bill Clinton, died Monday morning following a long battle with Parkinson's disease, her sister Maggy Hurchalla said. She was 78. Reno, the nation's first-ever female attorney general, served in the Clinton White House from 1993 to 2001	1
its very sad that  Sally Jessy Raphael Said that She Was ‘Betrayed’ By Talk Show Producers When Sally Jessy Raphael’s self-titled talk show aired in the ‘80s and ‘90s, it found success as a topic-driven program with relatively relatable stories. But by its end, Raphael tells “Oprah: Where Are They Now?” that her series had devolved into a show of salacious content and tabloid fodder like some of her talk-show peers, and she was not happy about it this makes a bad ending	0
Hey soul sista. I know this whole Crutcher thing has you shook. I am certain you have read more articles on this matter. Let me say that reading this worries me as well. My wife is worried for her daddy who lives in the area. Please do me a favor and bring this article up in your weekly political meetings. I just want to make sure this gets more movement along the grass root channels you work with. I am sending my best with this article to you.	2
Remember when I told you I had ringing in my ear sometimes? This article seems to parallel what I was talking about. Can you look into this further? I really trust your viewpoint on this. I am going to ask my doctor about this later on this week. I do not want this to get worse. Maybe you can advise on a good doctor I can see regarding this? I am just really worried about it. Thanks again man!	2
Did you hear about the horrible earthquake in New Zealand? IT was devastating and I am so heartbroken and sad for all of those people.It's going to be difficult to get aid to some places because the roads are severely damaged. Those people must be so terrified and worried. I'm sure they're hungry and in serious need of water and food and many are in need of shelter. I pray that God gives them all peace and comfort during this time.	0
Hey, did you read this article? I feel really bad for all who are dealing with these extreme weather crisis. Fires, floods, extreme heat is all getting out of hand and I am praying for everyone who has bee and will be harmed. I pray for a solution. There has to be something that can be done about this, right?	0
I just read the article and I am so surprised that this happened. I feel really embarrassed for her because it seems obvious that she's the one starting trouble but I worry that she might have some sort of mental illness or disorder that she really didn't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her. I can understand her concerns about racism but I think that she's just not very credible in this case. I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad. Crowe also doesn't seem like the kind of person to be racist or to bully someone for absolutely no reason, either.	0
It's almost funny because I was looking at something really similar to this on Steve Wilkos, that a baby got hurt after pushing through a window screen and Steve was yelling at her and saying how she was so negligent and a bad mom but I honestly think that it's not the parents fault. Sometimes accidents just really so happen and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents happen. It's really upsetting for all of those involved and I really feel for the mom in this case because she just lost her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is. She doesn't need society talking badly about her from behind closed doors. Accidents are just accidents and it can happen to anyone, although I think that everyone can agree that it's a really sad situation overall.	0
Hey buddy. Did you hear about this weird disease that is spreading amongst the frog population? Apparently it's a disease that happens due to people having ponds in their house. I worry what this disease could do to the local population of frogs. Tell anyone who has a pond to becareful with what they are moving in and out of their ponds.	5
Oh my god. Did you hear about this story of this family of two girls that got killed on Halloweed? Apparently they were hit in a trailer and that cause them to die. Could you imagine just wanting to go out and have fun while trick and treating but then you get the sad news that you daughters are dead? This is heartbreaking for that family.	0
Did you see this sad story? This holocaust survivor has died. She lived a fruitful life recreating a town and now she is dead. Do you ever think of how sad life can be. This person survived the awful genocidal regime of Hitler. Why do human beings seek to contribute so much pain to one another. It is a sad and horrible way of being.	0
I remember how hard I was to my mother especially in my teens.It can be rough and now I see that instead of how it use to be.As a kid you always think that you know what is best that you are number one.You don't really think about other people and their feelings and you tend to rebel and jsut be this horrible version of yourself.	0
you can never really trust a person.Someone can end up dead and those who are left in the wake are the ones that suffer.Really makes you think just how short of a life we have in comparrison.But having no sex can do something to a person.It is one of those things that we have a bond between a person and if something in a relationship is not working it can drive a person to do something they would normally not do.	1
I thought reading an article about iconic moments of women athletes would be quite a bit more interesting and moving than it was. Instead, it was mostly a rattling of championships and medal counts with very few anecdotal pieces of information. The only things that really stood out were the story of the marathon runner and the swimmer because there were interesting stories attached to them.	1
It's always sad to hear of entertainers, especially comics, losing their spark because of dementia. I wasn't really a Monty Python fan myself but I've heard a lot about them growing up and it seems that they were a great deal of fun for their fans. I know they influenced and produced some favorite comics of mine.	0
This sounds like a murder-suicide situation. That's what it always is when you hear there is no danger to the public. How awful that people choose to do this to each other and how awful that some poor kid had to be a witness to it all. That child will never be the same again. I wonder why people who choose to do something like this can't just kill themselves and leave everyone around them alone. It's sick.	4
I think the situation in allepo is really dire. I don't understand why the syrian government is trying to harm the people there whey they didn't do anything wrong. I think the whole situation is really sad and that a lot of innocent people are getting hurt for no reason. War is awful and I hope that there's a solution to it soon. I'm glad that the UN is trying to do something, but I just don't think that it's enough.	0
Since many of you guys are at the age of having children, I thought this would be something that is important to share. There is a virus called CMV I just read about that is causing devastating consequences in newborns. These children are being born with brain problems, hearing problems, and learning problems because the mothers aren't being told how to prevent it. Make sure that you wash your hands after being around toddlers, especially if you're pregnant!	2
Hey, I thought this was an interesting article about males born through medical fertilization. Apparently, these men are also more likely to suffer from the same problems as their fathers did with being able to have babies. It's sort of sad to think about it. The author suggest using a sperm donor instead, but I couldn't imagine doing that if I was in this situation.	0
This article I just read is pretty disturbing. It's about a guy who was trying to warm up inside a hot spring that fell into one that was way too hot, and was basically boiled alive. It's sad, and apparently one of the people with him caught it on camera. The really disturbing part comes when the authorities couldn't get to the body because of how hot it was, and when they came back, they discovered that it had dissolved completely. That part creeped me out.	4
I could not help but think of my and my son would we be in a similar situation. I know my son is much younger and the situation would be very different, but part of me can feel the water as we are swimming to get safe. I can see myself looking back to be sure that he is still with me, maybe reaching back to try to pull him closer. It is a very intense thought.	2
This is sad on the surface, that these two passed away while scuba diving at such an old age, but then I consider it. These two people - lived their life together - went somewhere glorious and had a wonderful time on vacation together before passing. It is morbid, yes, but is it not also somewhat beautiful?	0
This is such a sad story. I feel so much for the mother trying to get away. Sometimes it seems like things won't be so bad. Sometimes it seems like tomorrow is another chance, but it seems to me that you can't give people the opportunity to destroy because they will. I would always encourage a one strike policy for my friends. That reminds me, how was your friend after her husband threatened to shoot her - are they still together?	0
Did you see all of that stuff going on over in Syria and how Donald Trump in working with the Russian president to missile strike the people over there? Man, they really have it pretty bad with all of the stuff going on. I feel really bad for the people who are living there that really don't want any part of what is going on. Could you imagine having dinner and a missile comes flying over your house? I am definitely glad I live where I live.	0
Did you see what is going on with all those refugees? They are trying to cross over by water and a lot of them are drowning and there are record numbers for deaths from shipwrecks. Those poor people just want to get away and lead a better life and they all keep dying or continue to suffer. I really wish we could do something for them so they could all live better lives.	0
Hey, remember that eighties song "You Spin me Right Round" that people like to laugh about? The guy responsible for that just dies recently, he seemed like he was pretty interesting. I heard that he was on the UK version of Celebrity Big Brother, but I bet that show is just as boring as the American version. It's so interesting how the celebrity culture over there compares to over here.	1
It is just so messed up that there are so many places in the world without easy access to clean water. The answer is never to privatize or "modernize" the water system of a place, as that is really just an excuse to implement political policies. It is just bizarre that our modern water systems in urban areas are so woefully lacking. Even desert areas of India get enough rainfall each year that a simple catchment system would solve all of a community's problems.	4
Let's be real for a second - politics is and always has been a cruel and nasty game. These politicians throw insults at each other for months in order to win. That's what competition portrays itself as in politics. For this woman to suddenly become offended when she has thrown around plenty of insults herself is not just hypocritical, but also shows a lot of weakness on her part. I don't like her policies anyways!	3
Here is an article I just read about an accident at an amusement park in Australia. I've never heard of Dreamworld, have you? But the ride sounds like the old Shoot the Rapids we used to ride on at Cedar Point. In this case, the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor belt. I can't even imagine what the last moment of those people's lives must have been like. As for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no words! At least none of the children died in the accident. But now they have lost a parent. One of those kids was just a baby. Now she will never know her mother. I never thought about rides failing when we were kids and used to go to amusement parks, but now I would probably not ride on any of that stuff.	1
Here's an article about Standing Rock that I thought you would like to read. I think it's a few years old because it says the protests have been going on for five months, and I started following the Standing Rock case A LOT longer than five months ago. Barack Obama was still president then. I am very disappointed in the way he handled it and of course I have zero hope that Trump will do right by Native Americans at Standing Rock or anywhere else. We've had our own pipeline leaks here in Michigan, so the Lakota and Sioux who live in that area are right to be concerned. Even more so, it's their land and they have a right to tell the oil companies NO WAY.	0
I just read an article about how Billy Bob Thorton felt about his marriage to Angelia Jolie. He expressed that he did not feel good enough to be with her. This was kind of surprising. It made me feel empathic towards him. He stated that he did not like being around rich and important people. This made me feel like he is relatable. I did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together. It was a little gross. He even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in. I also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior. I found that to be a little old but I have seen it work. The article also briefly touched on her relationship with Brad.	0
So I just read an article where 2 friends went diving to a place they shouldnt have and ended up dying. While they were using brand new equipment, I feel like idiots who take stupid risks and go to places where no humans should be, kind of deserve what ends up happening to them. If you dont sky dive, you never have to worry about going splat when your chute doesnt open	0
Just read another "EPA" article promoting its usual bull shit. This time its the "a la The Simpsons fish with 3 heads" where a scientist is taking a picture of his ONE deformed Salmon he cought and wants the entire world to flip out about his 1 mutated fish. Well, ever seen a 4 leaf clover? Thats "mutated" as well right?	3
You know powerbars and protein bars? Well I just read about the next step called colon cleanse bars. No its not a diet food. Supposedly you eat it to "prep" your stomach for a colonoscopy. Well I bet you anything that in a week after production, every model and Hollywood actress starts popping these things as a diet pill	4
This is probably one of the most distressing articles I have read in my entire life, I really do not understand how this is even happening. Over and over again, we are showing to the black people in our country that we do not have the heart or the brains to care about them enough. It just makes me so mad!	0
It is really sad this country is still having major issues with prejudice and inequality. Being a minority myself, I feel for the Muslims and others who faced terrible treatment just because of their heritage. I hope you don't have to experience these terrible things as they have. I would be really careful who you talk to just to be on the safe side. It is an unpredictable world we live in today sadly.	0
The Somali peope are suffering greatly. I feel so bad for what they have had to go through over the past while. Donald Trump doesn't have enough mercy or understanding for what they are going through. The United States may offer some help, but not nearly enough. They will be in poverty likely their entire lives, and it is just not fair. There must be a way to test to see if they are dangerous, and if not they should be welcomed into our country.	0
Rhinos are going extinct, and it s a real shame since they do nothing to harm human life. They are a majestic creature with much to offer. However, they are being killed because of poachers and their horn. The black rhino is almost extinct. Only about five thousand still exist in the world today, and this is a real shame.	4
It's upsetting that species are dying out, sometimes before we even know they exist. I wonder if there are ways we can use science to bring them back, if they even survive if we do. We need to take better care of the environment. It's worrying that as these species die out, someday ours might as well.	0
There are three sides to every story: the one individual's side, the other party's side, and the truth. I'm not justifying that what the airlines did was right, but I believe there is much more to the story than what was reported. Granted, privacy issues come into play and not everything can be revealed; however, I take the complaints with a grain of salt.	1
Wow, just wow. I think that the possibility of nominating this judge for the Supreme Court really needs to be reexamined closely in that this nomination could cause bigger problems and chaos across the country. There would be heavy debates and fights from both sides and in the end, there unfortunately would be no progress.	5
There was more bombing over in Syria in the news over the weekend.  There were over 300 casualties including small children.  A father and son were found dead in the rubble as well as two boys whose mother survived in an adjoining room. It seems like the violence in the Middle East is never ending.	1
Here is an article that pretty much sums up what most people already know about Donald Trump and his campaign platform.  This is highlights some of the main points, including his stances on immigration, abortion rights, gun rights, Comey, the Clintons, and a variety of other topics.  It's a good refresher.	0
I wonder if this problems exists in the U.S. as well as the UK?  This is a consideration, since we both have garden ponds.  Maybe we should learn more about how to keep our ponds more sanitary for the frogs! I have noticed alot of frogs in mine, so this is interesting readying, anyway.  This is just another way that humans interfere with the natural environment, I guess.	5
I always wonder whether to believe articles like this.  I have always liked Mayweather, and I feel there are probably two sides to this story. Besides, the lawsuit is filed but there is no verdict yet, so Mayweather could be innocent.  Anyone can file a lawsuit and the only proof of who is right is when the suit is decided.  I will be interested to follow the outcome of this one.	1
Death to all cops! We cannot allow the police force to continue existing. They are nothing more than government sanctioned mass murderers that exist to protect White capitalist interests by slaughtering hundreds. We must deceively destroy the police as a concept without any hesitation or remorse. All police are our enemies! There are no good cops!	3
The only solution for the "wage gap" is the total abolishment of capitalism and all governments. There will be no more wage gap when there is no money! By instituting Anarcho-Communism, all people can be given what they need without a worry of who is getting more or less. Capitalism is evil and must be destroyed!	3
It's about time somebody stood up to Mexico.  We are being flooded with mexicans and immigrants flooding over the border.  It's an invasion as far as I'm concerned.  I could go into detail about all the negatives it causes.  But what I am sick of is every time we want to do something about it,  all the naysayers and doomsdayers through NAFTA and Trade and economics in our face.  I get it we made some dumb deals in the past that have lead to bad consequences,  but we elected Trump to take a new direction.  Mexico will have to get their act together too,  I'm sick of them acting like saints everytime we want to take an action.	3
It is very difficult for me to imagine how any person could leave a baby in a shoe box.  I just don't understand how you could even leave a baby alone.  Thank God the baby was in good health, at least whoever left the poor thing seems to have taken good care of it other than leaving it in a shoe box.  Maybe in the end this will turn out to be a good thing for this baby, one can only hope.	0
Remembering those who have lost their lives due to violence is so important. Do you remember what happened in Paris in 2015? I am so grateful that the people there set aside a special time to remember all the victims and their families. Such a senseless loss. People just wanting to enjoy some entertainment were met with a horrific experience and families were forced to wait in pain to hear news of the outcome. I am sure they will never forget that day.  I do hope each day gets easier for them and that they remember the good memories of their loved ones.	0
So I just read that article about Alexandria Vera. I know you know who she is, and I know the lawyer in you just wants to get in that case. I mean, can you imagine the nerve of a teacher to exploit a minor in that way. She deserves more than 30 years, if you ask me. And the parents of the minor ought to have been charged with something. That is disgraceful. I mean, what is happening in America today? Some of the things I read about make me sick!	4
I hadn't heard about this and I find it surprising. I initially thought of the ecological factor so it's a good thing that it was contained. It's worrisome that people are struggling to find gas anywhere. I imagine those areas don't have good options for public transportation or anything. Maybe it will push people to get smart cars or ride bikes.	5
I just read a very upsetting article about a recent incident involving U.S. troops in Jordan and I wanted to share it with you. There were three U.S. military trainers killed in gunfire by security units at Jordan base, fatally shot by security forces Friday when their vehicle failed to stop at the gate of a military base. I have no idea why the driver did not stop at the gate, which is certainly protocol. They have had serious problems in Jordan recently due to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees crossing their border. Jordan is and has been a significant U.S. ally in the war against ISIS and I can only hope that this incident is isolated and not part of a bigger problem. God bless the families of the deceased soldiers!	0
Man it crazy I just read an article about a disaster that struck Colatina, Brazil. The disaster struck when a dam ruptured and polluted the most important river in Brazil where people were getting their foods and surviving from what the river had to offer. Now it it polluted with mining waste because of the rupture of the dam. I feel really bad that they are in a position where they cant even eat the fish in the river because the fish showed some kind of mutation because of the pollution. It really sucks that a company just pays a minimal amount after causing a huge disaster like this totally unfair	0
It a tragedy when the people who are their to protect and serve us are gun down for no reason. My heart goes out to both families in this situation. It totally is unfair to die for no reason because of a selfish and ill man. It is really upsetting that this man just decides to kill police officers that are on duty to protect us from danger.	0
wow sleep paralysis sounds so scary! I hope that this never happens to me ! I think that It was affect me for a long time . I'm sure that those few short seconds that is happens seems like hours . I would probably have a heart attack from being so scared. Yeah  no thank you on any of that . I will be making sure I don't drink before going to  bed from now on.	2
I can't believe that there has to be so much violence and bad in the world.  The part of this article that really got to me was that the Muslim women were being raped and that doctors and nurses who wanted to help the people there were being treated rudely.  It would be awful to have to live under these kinds of conditions.  It would be awful to have the prices of food go up because of blockades and other reasons.  It would be stressful and scary.	2
I didn't realize that a dam could cause so much problem.  It is a shame that the people who are going to be impacted the most are the indigenous people.  I don't understand how people feel it is okay to do this to them.  Maybe there are many pros that I just don't know about and this article is focusing only on the negative of the methylmercury.  I guess this goes to show that we as a human race can affect the environment in maybe a not so good way.  What do you think about this?  I am curious what you have to say about this.	5
I guess people don't realize how much of an impact they can have.  The article says if people would have done something they could have stopped the extinction of the animals.  But at the same time, it is people's action indirectly that caused the extinction, through contributing to climate change.  There is so much that can go out of balance in nature when people are involved.  When one species dies off, then everything in that ecosystem changes.  I guess the article was kind of interesting.  But what is the solution the problem they are talking about?  How should people intervene to save those animals?	0
I am shocked and saddened by this earthquake. What a sad and terrible tragedy. I feel so sorry for all the victims and those affected by this event. I can't even imagine how devastating this must be for them. What an incredible catastrophe. My thoughts and prayers and best wishes go out for all the many people affected by this tragic catastrophe. I hope that everyone stays safe for the foreseeable future. I am still in shock.	5

I really don't fully understand what's happening in this article. I get that the players need sleep and that's about it. Do you know much about what they're trying to say here? I have such little knowledge of sports that I struggle understanding the lingo associated with the sport. I can understand sleep though!	1
I hate the conflict that is happening here. I feel for the three soldiers that died and their families. I guess I'm too much of a pacifist but I really wish that people could realize that this level of conflict is a waste of resources and lives. However, I also know that this isn't how the world works.	3
Why do people think they can just illegally enter a country? The article sounds so sympathetic and bias. Why do people act like coming here illegally is not breaking a law? "They haven't broken any laws!" Yes, they have. You break the law when you enter illegally! What the fuck! And you got Liberal scholars defending immigrants, repeating that nonsense of, "They don't break any laws!" What the fuck? As a Mexican, I am appalled by other Mexicans defending this nonsense and seeing Mexico encourage this illegal immigration shit. Mexico needs to fix itself so that it can house people that won't want to run away from it. Fuck Mexico, they have ruined a lot of lives and they are not held responsible. Quit being politically correct about Mexico. Hold them accountable.	3
It seems like the air pollution in India is getting worse and this is especially troubling for children who are very susceptible to the open air. This is very alarming as just recently 1,800 school had been close in India because of the poor air quality. It seem that these particle from the smog and fireworks are so tiny that they can make there way in the small pockets of the lungs.	2
Colonialism is a ugly part of American history, but it's one that we shouldn't forget. We can't undo the damage that we've done, but we can teach future generations our mistakes, and hope that they do not repeat them. A formal apology is the very least the Canadian government can do, and it is admirable.	4
Wow, it is scary to think there are mice that are twice their normal size hunting down and killing birds! It must be one scary place there right now with all that carnage. I hope Keith can make his plan come alive and stop the invasion of the mice. My concern is if they start getting off the island and migrating to other places. I live far away in America, but I sure don't want to run across these giant bird-eating mice. No thanks!	2
This is just sick. It kills me that this lady is a parent. I am more confused that the step-father had no idea. I doubt after moving to multiple houses that you would not have noticed something was off. I mean you never went into these closets? The biggest issue here though is that this woman thought she would rid herself of a problem because of social services checking in on her. It is disgusting. I am surprised the other kids survived. They all must have lived in fear of this lady. Makes me so mad people kill kids.	4
I have think is very good article and nice.he has promised the to be the most vigilant interrogator of the Obama administration from his perch on an oversight committee, which republican cheered. this sentence i am very like. Numerous ballot initiatives focused on progressive caused could also give republican few reasons to turn out. The reason must important for the areas.	6
The research team from Australia’s University of Queensland said the Earth has lost nearly 1.3 million square miles of wilderness. They’ve defined wilderness as an area with no human development. Dr. James Watson of the University of Queensland in Australia said globally important wilderness areas are completely ignored in environmental policy, and much has been paid to the loss of species. Without any policies to protect them, they are “falling victim to widespread development,” he added. Dr. Watson also revealed that humanity has one to two decades to turn things around. To date, the world has a total of 30.1 million km2, or around 20 percent of the world’s land area, that remain as wilderness, with the majority being located in countries in North America, North Asia, Australia and Nort	1
The Year's Strongest Storm Sweeps by Taiwan — Typhoon Meranti gathered in strength as it swept close to Taiwan on Wednesday, and with maximum winds of 230 miles per hour it has been called the strongest storm of the year. Meranti was classified as Category 5, the highest on the scale. The storm has brought not only high winds, but also heavy rain, and many Taiwanese cities have flooded. Trains and shipping services in some southern cities had stopped, and most flights were grounded. As of Wednesday, there were only a few injuries.	1
Yay, bigots! I know that bigots are not a particularly new species, but I used to think, just a few years ago, that things were much better and that people were generally becoming more open-minded and welcoming. But the election of our new president signals something very different. And very much encourages the bigots to spread their wings and parade proudly. They are being empowered right now, and that is very disturbing.	4
Hey, Billie bob Thorton  says Angelina Jolie was never good enough for him. He is older but she was younger, I guess he had no control over her at all. He stats that Angelina had a high stakes and fast lifestyle, even made him wear viles of blood around their necks. I guess her saw her as coo koo and a tad bit crazy or or something. Maybe he had to get away from her hectic lifestyle.	1
The spread of cholera is very widespread in Haiti. It is costing tons of lives, and money food and doctors are very much needed. Its hard to control like any other high spreading disease. Doctors need resources so much that they cant keep up with ever growing number of patients. They need food, medical supplies, and other miscellaneous equipment that would help them improve their job and combating the outbreak.	0
Mexico is disturbed by our current President Donald J Trump. Their currency Pesos dropped a lot when he was elected. Trump wants to build a wall between the two countries borders as well. The Mexican government seems very apprehensive about our new glorious President. Their economy might drop due to the building of the wall and lowering of all the immigrants trying to get into the U.S. by crossing into our borders.	1
Hey, I just read an article written by a snowflake that is melting under manmade "global warming". One thing I have never understood is how the communist party took over the environmental movement without a shot. Remember when we found out the founder of 'GreenPeace' left after discovering the flood of communist and socialist coming into academia and the organization he started? I wish someone would actually do some research instead of repeating the same old stuff.	3
Hey,  Measles is still killing kids around the world basically in the countries that don't take care of their people. The governments and terrorist organizations like Boko Haram don't care about kids. I gotta think this is just another example of pure evil, killing kids all the while the government takes aid, money, food, or whatever and keeps it for themselves or sells it to the people and puts them in servitude. God bless the USA!	4
Wow. That is really sad!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wonder why his friend would kill him. Must not have been friends after all, huh?????? I wonder how long the body had been there before he was found. Money was probably the motive since it usually is. He probably got over on him somehow and dude got his revenge. Oh well.......	0
Things are really bad in Afghanistan right now - I just read an article about the latest.  Refugees from European countries are being sent home to Afghanistan, only to see the turmoil first-hand.  And there are problems with resources getting to the people who need them.  So many displaced people in bad shape.  I wish countries would get together and share resources and welcome immigration.  If everyone had enough resources to live comfortably, things would surely improve.	0
Just read a short article about the Kim Kardashian robbery.  Pretty scary for her, and the robbers kept demanding money.  There were language/communication issues between her and the robbers, she thought they wanted her jewelry, and they wanted her money.  I hope that she gets better security in place so that this never happens again.  The article mentioned her providing information about her expensive diamond ring on Facebook - I think there's a lesson to be learned about that.	2
How can they do this to these people?  Did you see this?  How can you move people who were fleeing war and violence to another place after they had already settled there?  It's unbelievable, I feel so sorry for these people, and someone needs to step in and help them stay where they are currently comfortable.	2
I don't believe this at all.  I think people are overreacting to the news that Trump was elected president.  There are always bad apples out there, no matter who the president is.  To blame this on the president, right after he was even elected, is wrong.  Give the guy a chance and get over it and try to make something positive of this.	3
I don't really understand the uproar over some birds.  Maybe I am being just unsympathetic, or maybe I'm not as understanding as I thought I originally was.  To spend all this money, and all this time, to save these birds, seems kind of silly to me.  Why don't we focus the funds on something else that actually helps people?	3
It always upsets me when I read articles about land conflicts involving Native American tribes, especially when it involves oil pipelines. I fully support expanding domestic oil operations so as to better establish energy independence, but care should be taken to respect the needs of others when developing pipelines. It may be expensive to ensure environmental care is taken and, when necessary, to reroute the pipelines to avoid encroaching on sacred lands, but that doesn't mean it's not worth the expense.	0
I'm deeply disturbed to hear about actions being taking that could potentially curtail black Americans' ability to vote. The GOP has obviously been working to sabotage voting of minorities because they see them as a threat since they do not traditionally vote for Republican candidates. This needs to stop.	4
I bring you sad news today, my friend. A male wolf member of the Huckleberry pack has been slaughtered. How can they do this without consequences? This event happened in Montana. I have heard similar stories in that region of wolves being gunned down, especially from helicopters. It makes my heart feel heavy. I know you will feel the same way. I am strongly considering giving a donation to the Center for Biological Diversity because they are fighting on behalf of wolves to stop this murder. It was so cruel because the male was simply wandering for a mate. He didn't deserve what happened.	0
As it turns out, male models do not make as much as their female counterparts. I was not aware this was the case. The reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer career, whereas women are considered going downward after thirty. The gap in pay between them is quite high. Some people are doing their best to split the wages more fairly, but it appears to be the default to pay women more in this industry. I think more men are paying attention to their grooming habits. I hope that men will earn more fair wages in the future.	5
I think with all the social media and news stories, recent incidents involving terror attacks, and those who are of a different race commuting these acts, especially since the 9/11 attack this will always be an issue with people because we are just alarmed, even though some may have nothing to do with terrorism or any type of situation regarding that but they will always be perceived that way because of what happened in the past. It's probably not right of those who are discriminating and the airlines really need to do something about all the complaints.	1
I'm not so sure that there is any right in this situation, of course it was wrong what he did and he could have handled this another way. He did what he did for his own reasons and he can't take that back and he definitely does not feel sorry for what he did. Was it so serious just because he is the mayor and would it not been so serious if he wasn't a mayor? Could he have done something better with the money? Absolutely, so he isn't wrong when he says the money should have been used for other things, but throwing a pie in someones face probably isn't the best way to show it	1
I feel sad when reading this story, as she lost her companion and that's just what some animals are to people their companion, not just a dog or a pet, it's a part of them. This man was wrong for what he did although he was justified because it was seen as self defense he definitely could have done something else before fatally shooting the dog and killing it. Unless the dog was charging at him and starting to bite him or bark at him he should have seen no threat at that time and I feel like this was a careless mistake and he didn't need to do so.	0
What a rare occurrence to have that mutation come up for both parents. I feel very bad for Nicholas and his family. Thankfully they are able to afford the treatments that Nicholas would need almost his entire life. I feel bad for the family who aren't able to afford such treatments for their own kids.	0
These people are dumb for voting for him. They can't even tell that he's exploiting their feelings and has no intentions to helping them. He's just taking advantage of the situation for his own gain. They'll find out soon and they'll be the ones who end up suffering most from this. I don't really have too much sympathy for them.	3
It really is too bad that this had to happen.  The internet will never let them forget.  I'm sure the zookeepers feel awful about what has transpired.  After all, They are probably all great lovers of animals and you and I know that it is never easy to see a poor animal die.  I wonder if there were things to be done that could have prevented this or if I am just thinking with insight.	0
So, about climate change, I just read an article about it.  I have never really been concerned about climate change, I think it's a huge act that is exaggerated by the government, media, and everyone in between.  The facts about fire increasing are a little scary though... but I still think climate change is irrelevant.  Maybe fires just happen more	2
This whole article is a little sketchy, it seems like they're hiding stuff.  This article, if you want to be really cynical and skeptical, makes it sound like the kids might be responsible for the deaths of the parents.  It seems like a pretty vague article, I wish we had more information on this incident.	1
the reports of officers being killed just because they are police officers is obsurb. Police officers all get a bad reoutation because you got some dumbass officer that kills someone they had no right killing and all officers are tagged as murderers and corupt. officer are here to protect and serve you and keep you safe	4
i could care less what isis does as long its not done in my country. I think they should all be put to death and be done with it. They are a terrorist group and deserve all the bad things that are going to happen to them. I do feel bad for the lose of life and feel sympathy for the families of the officers killed.	3
I think its fine that people protest. I dislike president Trump as much as those protesters. But what they are doing its wrong. They cant be destroying property or been a menace for other people. Guys, do it peacefully, that's the best way to do things, otherwise you will get arrested and in trouble.	0
This really sucks for the children and the families affected. They could sue the developers, but no amount of money is going to compensate them for the health issues these kids are going to experience due to lead poisoning. The worst thing about this is, if it were a wealthy white neighbourhood adjacent to the industrial site they wanted to demolish, you know they would have taken every precaution to test to see if there was any chance of releasing toxic amounts of lead into the vicinity. But it's a poor black neighbourhood, so of course they aren't as careful.	4
Hey you, I found more information about that woman who overdosed in the car with her infant.  It is just horrible.  From what I am reading it happened in Indiana and she had a syringe in her hand.  Her poor baby was only 10 months old.  How sad.  They were parked outside of a Dollar General when thankfully someone noticed and called 911.  The grandmother got guardianship over the baby, thank goodness.  The women got booked on neglect and possession, hopefully she stays in there for awhile.	0
It's very upsetting to me that people feel they still need to poach elephants and rhinos just for their ivory. It's a species that you are making extinct here. Why are people not trying to control or help the situation more? There has to be some kind d of co trolling standards for the extinction of the rhino and elephant. I believe I saw something not that long ago that actually painted the tusks and got s of elephants and rhinos that permantely stained them so the poachers work not beable ti use the ivory. They stained them a pink or blue color. We should try and regulate that and do that so no one will kill these animals. If that's possible.	0
I am a firm believer of inoccent till proven guilty. But come on. There are multiple accounts with several different wome. That are coming forward towards this guy. This man needs taking off of the streets and put in jail. The things he did to multiple women is disgusting. I feel bad for these women who did not come forward in the beginning. Whether they were scared for their lives or just ashamed. It seems like alec could get a girl but just took things to far and to the next level. It ashame that a successful young man does something like this and ruins his entire life. Over sex.	4
i was reading about a dad who lost his daughter in the Charlie Hedbo attacks in Paris. it was touching. i mean, it was dark, him talking about losing her and those feeling, as well as those of other people who lived it. but his story touched me. he was talking about all the notes he recieved and how there was such an outpouring. he wrote a book, and he's healing. nice to see theres some form of recovery after something so awful	0
so theres this push to remove your money from banks involved in the pipeline screwing over the souix . Im thinking about it. kick the banks that are kicking the native americans seems like a good way to make a point. all the understand is the bottom line, and the pipeline company will lose their backers if they begin to lose too mkuch money	3
so Trump's guy of SCOTUS is anti LGBTQ. he's so far off the mark its insane. wants to outlaw gay sex basically. like, WHO is gonna enforce what happens in someones bedroom? I cant with this adminstration anymore. where will it end? just let people love who they want... crazy homophobes are gonna make america a whole new version of hell	3
I am upset and disturbed about the result of the investigation on the article. It also saddens me to know that the families involved in the missing of those students are still hoping to see their family member even after years of waiting. This article reminds me that no matter how long the case, the family will always wait for them to hug those missing students.	0
I am stressed about this article since gasoline is involved. Gasoline is a big thing not just for me, my family, my frienda but it is a big thing for everyone. It is always a bad news to know that something like this happened or happening because it will slow down the work we have to do. It destroys plans and budget of every individual.	0
Our country is really at a place right now where its going the wrong direction of what an ideal society should be and how a lot people are worried about the future as well. This has clearly been shown with the spike of suicide hotline and crisis calls. We need to create a more positive and acceptable society in order for every person to feel appreciated on a daily basis. As well as we should be taking care of the environment to minimize all these environmental effects such as massive disastrous like hurricanes cause by human abusing the environment.	2
Its crazy that really intense and sad situations are happening around the world but here in USA were worried more about who made it passed the first round of the Voice or whats the latest viral videos. The fact the extremists are using innocent civilians as human shields is so cowardly and shows they have no honor what so ever.	4
This is going to sound insensitive, but this article was rather dry. And I just realized that that was a horrible pun. Anyways, this article is illustrating the harm of over pumping water sources in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It sounds like a really terrible situation, with arsenic being a terrible poison that's being pushed around by all of this negligence. You should read it.	3
How horrible! I don't care what crime anyone has committed, beating a person and then setting them on fire is detestable! I hope and pray that the authorities will be able to find out where this video originated from and bring the perpetrators to justice! It makes me sick that a human being could do that to another human!	3
Those poor people! I can't believe the government is seriously considering leveling 783 houses! And especially ones that have historical value! There are other ways to increase your air travel options and industry without doing damage to so many people's lives! I feel awful for those people and, if I were them, I'd fight back too!	3
Did you see the article about the attack in the mall in MI? Can you imagine, just minding your own business, and then this guy dressed as a security guard starts stabbing people, yelling something about Allah??? Thank GOD there was an off duty cop there to stop him, or imagine how long he could have gone on for? This is getting crazy. We've gotta do something. I don't want to be worried about my safety just going to the mall.	2
I read this article about what black people think. It is crazy that they still believe they are being targeted by the police. Can you believe in this day and age they still believe that. The difference between why more black people get shot is more of them do crimes. Add to the fact that black families tell their kids not to trust the police. Don't run, Don't fight back and do what the police officer says and you have a lot great chance of not getting shot. I can't stand these black people who feel like they have it so bad here. Let them try living back in Africa and see how they like that.	3
I just read about the Haitians who came here after the earthquake. While I wish we could help everyone we just can't. Only so many resources in this country and unless we want to become another 3rd world country we have to send them home. Make them wait in line just like any other legal immigrant. Why should they be given special privileges to be in this country. I hate to be mean but if you aren't here legally then you have to go home.	3
This is just more violent nonsense from the outrageous middle east.  Honestly, I dont care any longer.  All these people clutching to one religion or another (often just as a mask for their rage) and killing each other out of tribal animus.  It hasnt changed, well, ever.  I dont expect it to change now.  Its hopeless because people are just ignorant, solipsistic apes.  I just cant care any longer about these idiots.  Its horrible and tragic but it's all so preventable.	3
So apparently even turtles are poised to suffer from our careless destruction of the planet vis a vis degradation to habitats due to climate change. Though it seems like they will be able to withstand the changes in temperature, it is not at all clear what will be the outcome of the potentially lost habitats they live in due to climate change. These guys have been around longer than we have, as a species. It's really sad to think that we would be responsible for endangering them even further than we already have.	0
I had no earthly idea that Michael Douglas had battled oral cancer. I found out in an article talking about a remark he apparently made regarding Val Kilmer, who ostensibly also may or may not be battling oral cancer. Setting aside the absurdity of the media relaying a he said-she said moment with no relevance to the greater world beyond the individuals to whom it applies, it is terrifying to think how prevalent cancer is.	2
It's just so distressing to read about the negative effects we constantly have on defenseless animals. Human beings need to be more respectful of the planet and its native biodiversity. I just finished reading an article about an endangered species in the Gulf called the Vaquita that is slated to be extinct by 2022 due to nothing beyond happening to be in the water where people are fishing. It's just so thoughtless, so shortsighted, and so frustratingly preventable.	3
I just read an article about elephants and how they are becoming extinct due to people being more concerned towards their need fr ivory than they are for the precious lives of elephants. I don't understand why people have such little regards for the well being of the elephant species, knowing that they are on the verge of extinction and it upsets me severerly knowing that we are taking them for granted.	0
I just read an article about someone jumping a fence and into someone's yard before stabbing several of the homeowners security guards. Just reminds me of how decrepit society has become. It's as if we've lost all touch with morality and compassion towards one another and such crimes are a grim reminder of the reality.	4
Wow, this is tragic. I really hope that China will improve their safety standards, but I know this is a big problem all over in developing countries. Remember when that factory burned down in Bangladesh? And we can't pretend this isn't our problem too, when we support them economically. If we buy products created in unsafe working conditions, we have a hand in those deaths too.	0
Oh, Yahoo. I wonder what country they're talking about? Probably Russia. It's always Russia nowadays. I'm glad I stopped using Yahoo years ago. I feel vindicated. Not that Google or any of the other services I give information to are immune. It's just that Yahoo has such a bad, ugly, sad interface. And now this.	0
I was sad to hear that a woman was critically injured Sunday evening in a multiple car wreck in the Clinton area of Prince George’s County. It seems like these things are becoming more common. At least the reporting of such accidents is more common. People should pay more attention to their driving. I wouldn't be surprised at all if someone involved was distracted by cellphone use.	0
I just read an article about how the CO2 levels are high this year and they might not lower for generations to come. That is so sad for our children and grandchildren. I feel like instances such as this can cause health issues. Not only am I concerned about myself but Im concerned about my children and future grandchildren.	0
Another sad story. I am deeply sorry for the families of the innocent civilians that were killed but our United States army has to do what it has to do in order to protect our great country and keep us all safe as Americans. Living in those types of countries is a risk and sometimes innocent peoples lives have to be taken in order to keep us safe and protect our country.	0
It’s a sad day when young kids are killing themselves. They act on impulse and do not realize that their actions have lasting consequences. If someone was just their to listen to these kids a lot of this probably wouldn’t be happening. Its just so sad especially for the parents and grandparents but also for the whole family.	0
Trump refuses to take a salary from the government for being president. Well he is rich so $400,000 is probably nothing to him. Its saving the government but that would probably be the only smart move hes made since hes been in the white house period. Im not a Trump supporter but I like the idea that he chose to save the government money.	6
Hello, I have just read this article and have to say that it was a very good and interesting read. It is about the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and they discuss how smoking should be banned in all parks, zoos, and playgrounds to reduce the chances of children growing up thinking that using cigarettes is normal. I can see why some might say that this is the last step before criminalization of the product and consumer.	1
I just read an article on the decision this week to dismiss the Kenyan general in charge of the peacekeeping force there. I agree that the restoration of a peace agreement is important and vital in this situation. I hope they can figure it out and the fighting that is happening all over the country can finally end and they can have peace.	2
It looks like Wells Fargo was illegally confiscating cars of service members to pay off debts, repossessing them. This is a terrible situation and thing to do, I can't imagine having my car repossessed, and how awful that must be on so many levels. Not having your car, having to watch them take it away, and everything.	2
I can't imagine the fear and anger that must be happening for these people to not only be attacked in this manner but to be in such a remote area that help cannot get you in a timely fashion.  These senseless acts are obviously those of cowards that have no regard for human life and should be captured and dealt with harshly.  There is not enough room in this world for people that would do this to others for any cause or religion.  I hope that everyone that can be saved and cared for is able to get what they need in order to recover physically.  I know that the emotional healing for all of them and their families will take much more time and help for these poor people that have had to endure such an atrocity.  I can only hope we never see events such as this in my own family.	3
Hey friend,  Can you believe just how crazy this is getting over in the middle east? My heart weeps so much for the families and just the innocent bystanders that have to deal with this. Imagine if your home was getting bombed and who knew where you would get your food next. I can't imagine the pain that they go through on a daily basis meanwhile I can go get any kind of food I want or drinks or whatever. Not a worry in the world for me, meanwhile these people are being bombed and just all around treated like cattle. We need peace!	0
I agree with this article completely. I used to take the pill for awhile and it did change my moods and make me feel weird and just off. So I switched to the depo shot and same thing. It made me feel super depressed and also made me gain a lot of weight. I have had some kind of bad side effect with every birth control I've ever tried. I refuse to take any form of birth control now except for condoms and I track my cycle so I know when I'm fertile.	6
Wow! I cannot believe I forgot about the Zika virus! How can we advance as a society to try to grasp a better understanding of this deadly virus? You would think as advanced as human civilization is we would understand more. Pregnant women who get Zika seem to be in the most danger. The effects it can have on the fetus is horrible! It is very scary to know that it can be passed along sexually even if a person was not feeling the symptoms.Africa and Asia seems to really need help fro the rest of the world in fighting this problem!	5
I can't believe what a nuisance gold fish can be. The fact that they can cause so much damage to an environment and have no natural predators is crazy. It makes you second guess flushing the fish down the toilet as it may survive. It's hard to believe that they get so big since they are usually just little fish in a small tank. Also it's weird that they travel so far considering we usually just see them swimming in circles.	5
It seems pretty suspicious to me that a machine that was off could just turn itself back on. I'm sure somebody either accidentally turned it on or do it on purpose. That sounds like a really awful way to go though being crushed like that. They better come up with some better safety requirements to make sure that doesn't happen to anybody ever again.	2
I remember this going on. I knew someone who considered this option. It's a shame that women have to think like this, about birth control meant to outlast a political regime. Trump and Pence are reprehensible, but at least it hasn't come to pass - not that they wouldn't salivate at the opportunity to attack women's health like this, we've just been lucky so far that they haven't got their way. It bothers me how these guys think.	0
I think there are way to many people watching CNN in this country. They need to grow up. People are way to sensitive. We can not walk around on egg shells worrying about if we are going to offend someone. People will say mean things. People will hurt your feelings. grow up and get over it. Don't let it bother you. These people do not rule your life. You do!	3
Of course I only know what I read in the article.  It sounds like it could be the ex police officer was trying to protect himself.  The son was already arrested for assaulted the father. I believe the police will investigate the shooting and take the necessary actions. I don't think the police will look the other way just because he is an ex police officer.	1
This man should be found guilty. There is no way he forgot that his son was in the car. The child would have been able to speak. He would have been in a front facing car seat. there is no way he didn't see him. He is guilty and he needs to be punished. He should be put in prison for life. This poor child suffered a great deal and this man needs to suffer.	3
A new study shows injected sperm birth or ICSI have shown long term studies of males born in this matter have lower sperm count. I feel they need a larger testing pool and they also need to understand the lifestyle of the men tested. Usually people that would need a special method to give birth are wealthy as well as unhealthy. Most likely thier offsprings have adapted to this similar lifestyle.	1
So the police found this woman wondering the streets in Philadelphia at 1 am with no coat on in the cold. She was in some kind of daze, probably alzheimer's or something. Anyways, their trying to identify her. It would suck to be in that state of mind. Sounds horrible and potentially scary if your cognizant enough.	2
A car Taliban car bomb exploded in front of the German consulate in Afghanistan. It killed 100 people.These type of events are to come these days. I mean how does anyone process them any more. I'm personally numb to all this now. It might as well be fiction at this point.  It seems like I hear about similar incidents like this everyday. I don't know.	0
It seems wind turbines are killing a lot of birds. In particular the golden eagle which is an endangered species, I believe the article said. I don't understand why they don't cage in the turbine blades like they do with house fans. I mean it sucks bird kind everywhere, but it's either the turbine or toxic smog.	5
Hey just wanted to share this article with you and let you know some thoughts/feelings about it. I know that we have talked before about the importance of vaccinations, and if it is safe for kids to get them. I think this story really made me think about that and brought fourth some really interesting facts and data that make you see how it is changing and hurting different parts of the world. I feel that kids should receive these vaccinations as they are a easy way to help and protect people all over the world rather than taking a risk.	1
Hey,  I think that you should check out this article. I feel bad for the citizens down in Mexico City and South America. They are going through some troubled times and America is barely doing anything to help out with their situation. Those children do not deserve the life they are going through at the moment and I believe that we should do something to make them feel like they are proud to be apart of their country.	0
Hey,  This is some sad news. The rhino couldn't be saved from his infectious diseases, so he had to be put down. I feel bad for the animal as he or she didn't have to live this way. In addition, it was difficult to find treatment for the rhino, so I feel bad for the veterinarians that had to take care of the rhino.	0
Toughie, the world's last Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog and a symbol of the extinction crisis, has died at his home in the Atlanta Botanical Garden.The famed frog's age is unknown, but he's at least 12 years old, and likely older, because he was an adult when collected in 2005.Mark Mandica, who worked with Toughie for seven years, says the frog's story isn't entirely unique. “A lot of attention had been paid to him in captivity, so he even has his own Wikipedia page,” Mandica, head of the Amphibian Foundation, notes. “But there are plenty of other species out there that are disappearing, sometimes before we even knew that they were there.”In fact, Toughie's own species (Ecnomiohyla rabborum) wasn't described until 2008,	1
Police in Hope, Indiana, released a chilling photo of a mother passed out behind the steering wheel of her car from an apparent drug overdose with a syringe in her hand. Crying in the backseat: her 10-month-old son. Parents are doing this more often with children in the car because they are doing it away from someone who is going to disapprove,” marshal Matthew Tallent told IndyStar. “This is becoming a new norm for drug users	1
This article held some very valid views that I have been trying to explain for years. The hypocrisy that America generates is overwhelming and others can see this too. We are holding ourselves so high up as a free country meanwhile a black man can not even get pulled over without having a white man pulling a gun on him.	4
These poor people in Syria. On the lookout all the time, every time you hear a bang or a noise they must shake. This is so bad these poor people were just going to school. The place you should feel safe. Your trying to make yourself better to learn something. If Russia targeted this school then I hope they get what they deserve. They should think about their families when carrying out an attack such as this.	0
Another example of the Government disregard for the Indian people who lived here before we ever arrived. Sad in this day and age they are just trying to protect their land. Stop the potential for environmental damage to the land where they have lived for thousands of years. Don't we learn anything from history. How can they shot and harm these people just protecting their land and way of life.	0
Looks like American Apparel is at it again and declaring bankruptcy.  Ironically they are getting bought out by a Canadian company.  I feel sorry for the employees, but its hard to feel sorry for the company since they just dont seem to get it.  I think one chance is fair, but when you have to declare bankruptcy again a year later your management doesnt seem to know what they are doing.  Maybe the company that bought them will finally get it right.	0
This is a sad state of affairs, but what do you expect from a country that is as corrupt as Russia.  The ruling class has a stranglehold on the wealth and the average person gets next to nothing.  The country is barely a step above a third world country in most parts, while the rich get richer and Putin profits.  There is not that much difference now than in the 70's and 80's except now the corruption is out in the open and there are billionaires all over the place.	5
Well, I dont really feel much about this either way. I feel badly for the family of the victim, I'm sure they are devastated, but it's not surprising something like this would happen, given the type of things he wrote, and the climate in the country in which they lived. My thoughts of out to the family.	0
I wonder if I recognize this guy.  I haven't heard of him up until now.  He was just a little before our time, although I'm sure he had an impact on many of the people we know.  It seems like he influenced many other comedians that I know. I plan on looking up his work to see what is out there of him.	5
I can't begin to imagine going through that night. The recollection from the survivor is horrifying.  I cannot fathom the thoughts and emotions of those who were there trapped for hours.  The loss of so many makes it easier to become desensitized to it, but hearing the individual stories makes it so real and sad.	0
I just read this article about a forest land in Indonesia that could potentially be cut down and turned in to a tree plant. Normally an article like this might not attract my attention and cause me to read any further, but this particular forest land is home to the 3rd largest population of endangered orangutans and if the forest is cut down, it is estimated that 1750 orangutans will die or have to be rescued and re-homed. This is so heartbreaking to me because these are innocent animals, endangered ones at that, that are just living in their natural environment and have done nothing wrong. How can the government in Indonesia think that this idea is even a possibility, never mind the fact it could not possibly be a positive thing because of the negative impact it has on this species!!	0
I just read an article about the attacks in a syrian town. It sounds horrible what they are going through. It talks about women and children dying. I tried to immagine what it would be like to live in such horror. It mentions many post on social media of pictures and videos. I would be interested in seeing some of the pictures and videos of this violence. Reading stuff like this really makes you appreciate being in America.	0
I just read an article about suicide, it was really sad. It started off talking about a 12 year old girl who was interested in suicide groups online. One day she went to school, or so her mother thoght. The mother recieved a phone call from the channel A&E notifiing her that her daughter had took her own life. The article went on to say how Russia was third in the world in suicides. It was a really sad article.	0
I feel very sad for the civilians who are caught in the crossfire. It's sad that people are stuck in the middle of this conflict. I wish there was a peaceful resolution. Both sides should really keep the ceasefire if only to protect the civilians who are caught in the middle. Those people have no control over any of this.	0
I feel bad for the migrants who died when the ship which was carrying them sunk. Especially the young ones. Kids shouldn't have to die like this just trying to take a risk to improve their lives. I am touched by the state of the tiger population. They should never be raised and kept in this fashion. They deserve to be free. On top of this rare species should always be protected.	0
Can you believe how people are acting over this? They are acting like a bunch of rabid animals. This is not how you protest. Going around acting violent and destroying things does not solve anything. This is chaos. There is no excuse for this type of behavior just because you don't agree with an election.	3
I just read another article about clashes over in the middle east and I am sending it over to you. This kind of thing has been going on forever ,,, my whole life and I have to admit that I am becoming immune to these types of stories and lost all empathy for these people. Normally you would read a story such as this and be heartbroken for the women and children who lost their lives but there is a story (or 2 or 3 or 10) like this every day and for decades and no end in sight. So just pile up the bodies of the woman and stack up the children murdered. Herd the maimed into a corner and block it all all of your concious. Too much insanity and too much gore to think about so the healthy thing for you do is just ignore these stories since there will a new one or two or ten tommorrow and forever	1
The article also good.but some times also said medical teams were examining the bodies and trying to determine their identities. “The investigation is just beginning,” he said. The Iraqi Joint Command issued a brief statement condemning the Islamic State. “Gangs of ISIS militants continue to commit crimes against our people,” the military said. Fighters from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, have held the city of Mosul and surrounding towns and villages for more than two years.	1
The artical also Trump campaign was unprecedented in its dishonesty; the fact that the lies didn’t exact a political price, that they even resonated with a large bloc of voters, doesn’t make them any less false. No, our inner cities aren’t war zones with record crime. No, we aren’t the highest-taxed nation in the world. No, climate change isn’t a hoax promoted by the Chinese. So if you’re tempted to concede that the alt-right’s vision of the world might have some truth to it, don’t. Lies are lies, no matter how much power backs them up. And once we’re talking about intellectual honesty,	3
Trump is a fool. Climate change is real and it's starting to effect us directly. I wonder when he'll realize we have to do something. How much does it take? Maybe his golf curse has to catch fire just like the forests. This doesn't only effect us but the whole world and the life on it. United States needs to take action before it's too late.	3
A lot of these news go unnoticed I feel. We have war in Syria and war everywhere. We have accepted it as a part of the world. It's such a shame that it's like this. Conflict has always broken us down and it's never been necessary. I don't know for how long this war has to continue. But I really feel sorry for all the lives that's been lost in this conflict.	0
It really doesn't make since to me that someone would come to America and then carry out terrorist attacks. I would think they would stay in their own country if they hated this one so much. So I really wonder who the supposed terrorist are. The news media and government would have to do a better job explaining why the "terrorist" are carrying out these attacks because the reasons that they give doesn't make much sense to me. It just creates even more questions than answers.	5
I think it's a shame that they made the employees create fake accounts in order to drive up the sales. What a shame. Why are they blaming the employees when it was those in higher positions who were forced into doing what they did. If they wasn't forced then it never would've happened. I feel sorry for the worker, but I would've quit before they had me do something fraudulent.	0
It is known that colonoscopy saves lives, but the preparation can be so unpleasant. I am so happy that researchers are working towards making it more tolerable so that more people will undergo the procedure that can save their lives. I am happy that many different options are available: not all involving colon cleansing (e.g. X-rays), that there is a dietary advice to minimize the discomfort (which food to eat before the procedure), etc. So, the person’s quality of life, their well-being in the short term is taken seriously into account.	6
Global warming is real. The effects that is having on the polar bears will soon have the same effects on us. The research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and hunting. The ice is melting at a constant rate, but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b time that they spend on the ice. They do most of their hunting on the ice and that how to meet their mates, so it is very important to them. It may not seem important to you yet, but as the Ice melts it will not only hurt the bears it will hurt you too. Rising sea level will hurt people like you that live in coastal areas. I hope you change your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice. Our actions may have an affect on the polar bears and I believe we should think about it.	2
We all live in the same America. I believe that we all have the same hopes,dreams and goals. I can understand to some Trump represents the return of jobs and other industry, but to others he is a symbol of hate. I know you voted for him and I know that you are not racist, but can you see how much this has torn the country apart? We both know that the country was not already united as one, but this has made it worst. I do not see it getting any better anytime soon. I hope the country can heel and both sides can work it out.	0
Why do people do this. I would really hope that people did not take their own life, but if you are going to take your own life, why take other people's lives with yours? Why would you kill your own children, I do not know what kind of pain this man was going through, but I do not believe he should have taken that pain out on his children. I wonder how we can prevent this from happening. Are there early warning signs that we can spot? Did he ask for help in his life? I just really feel sorry for the children, they never got to live nowhere near a full life.	3
Before reading this article I use to think that Flint was the only major water problem and I know that people have more on, but Flint is still having a water problem. I'm mad that California is the only state to pass laws for people to have rights to clean water. I know California has water issues with drought, but nobody should go with out clean water. Reading the article, reminds me that this is a world wide issue and we must figure a way to provide fresh and clean water to everyone. Especially those in need.	3
How awful. I have the feeling things like this are going to get more and more common - racists are going to feel more comfortable and much bolder if there's someone in office that seems to approve of actions like these. We need a leader who takes a strong stance against racism and hate crimes like this, or our country will continue to fracture.	2
It saddens and scares me that people don't see terrorists for what they are: radicalized individuals who have gone rogue. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people who just want to live their lives and practice their faith. This country needs to be educated on other cultures so we stop fearing the unknown. Building more walls and dividers between different groups of people won't help anything.	0
I am not sure what I just read. It seems to be about some sports event which I care little about. Sports are not my favorite thing and I don't know how anyone could lose sleep over a sports event. Much more important things in life. I also am not sure how to write such a long talk based on a very short paragraph about sports.	3
This is a dangerous occupation and I wish no one would do it. Some have to feed their families so I understand if it's the only job available. However- the government should make it safe for them. It is unavoidable and it seems it cannot be made safer. My condolences. I wouldn't want my family to work in one.	2
I don't know how they do it. They get abused in their own country, then abused by orgs that are supposed to help. I simply don't know why they would want to live. They are very strong. No org HAS to help them but if they sign up to help- then help. I think some are doing the best they can to help. However- more has to be done- Animals can't be left this way, so why can people?	0
Hello Jane, how have you been, I want to vent out an article I read and is very heart breaking.  A few families lost their loved one in a ride at the Dreamworld theme park in Queensland, Australia.  They were thrown off the ride into the water.  It is a very sad story and it will be investigated, also the Dream world CEO has created a memorial at the park with 500 staff to attend, which is very kind.	0
So, in India there's a lot of corruption and the Prime Minister made a promise to stop it. He made a pretty extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country, so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out. There was a grace period, but the country was really unprepared for it still. The banks didn't have enough smaller bills to trade to people. The poor weren't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at ATMs. Someone made a really good point that the real money from corruption is stored in Swiss banks. I agree!	3
A hurricane is about to hit Taiwan soon. It's supposed to be really big, the biggest since 1969. We just had some really awful hurricanes in the West too. The ones here were caused by global warming, so I wonder if China's are too? It's horrible that so many people will lose their homes or their lives just so rich executives can make a few bucks more.	2
We are living in a world that ha problems left and right and sometimes I can't help but to be sad because so many people and animals are suffering.Rivers are drying in some places and ll the fishes are dying while some areas have flash floods that destroy things and kill people.This are end times and am saddened all the time by such issues.	0
Another Muslim attacking Americans right here at home and you hardly hear or see anything about all these smaller attacks happening to regular people every day all over the country. And of course, they chime right in with excuses and the "don't judge us all" when they do nothing to stop it. They don't even condemn it at all, which really telling.	4
People love to go and see animals and experience them in the wild, especially in their natural habitats. You have to stop and think how this can be affecting these said animals. Public access to wild animals in their natural environment can drop birth rates and even cause death to the animals. They can become endangered and some people even go as far as to hunt them.	1
Just read that due to climate change, hotter than normal temps may be the new normal. In 2013, temps screamed up to 122 F. in Australia, which is frightening. But when you think about who really has the capacity to change this -- which is each individual -- it gets even more frightening. The primary cause of climate change is just too many people, full stop. I do not have much hope that people will stop procreating to save themselves, and this is the biggest tragedy of all.	2
I read an article about a young mother-to-be who lost her twins, prematurely, after being shot in the stomach. It really raises a good question for me and a lot of people, which is: when do we consider a life to begin? As for me, I consider life to begin when a human takes his or her first breath. Possibly a religious thing, I guess -- my parents and grandparents and entire family believed the same. But because there is no unified belief system as to this issue, I find it difficult to form an opinion as to how people should be prosecuted when a fetus is harmed. I really wish there were one answer to this problem.	0
After reading the article about Azalia Banks and Russell Crowe, I must say it was rather humiliating. They treated her really bad. I felt compassion for her. I tried to put myself into her shoe and I know I would have broken down and cried. She should have controlled her tongue as well, violence begot violence and a soft answer turns away wrath. Russell is not much of a lady's gentleman he could have dealt with the issue in an amicable manner. Maybe they could just let bygones be bygones and put it behind them. It was rather unfortunate.	0
Religion should be a freedom of choice. Some people are Christians and some are Muslims or Islamic. This makes me sad Christians chose a different religion so why should the Islams brutalize them and hurt them? That is cruelty and one of the reasons why there will always be war in those countries. I don't think I would ever want to visit those places, I would be very scared. They target Christians and kill priests. These people are heartless, forcing these people out of their home.	2
I blame this on the neo-liberal policies of Barack Obama. He made a lot of hope and change promises and delivered nothing. After 8 years peoples lives haven't gotten better. Having a choice between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is ridiculous. The mainstream media carries a lot of this blame as well for not informing the public about issues and only reporting sensationalism garbage.	3
There should be a class action lawsuit against the company putting out dangerous products. They are liable for any injuries they have caused. People should be given restitution for the damages they have suffered. I am glad Kylie is speaking out against this and hopefully she can prevent further injuries to unsuspecting consumers.	3
Leonard Cohen just died. Knew little about him but now see Ill have to look into his songs and writing. He was the epitome of the starving writer, it seems. His popularity continued to grow as he aged, and he was able to reap some rewards, but it didn't really catch up with his needs until recent years. He was a Buddhist monk, too. Had no idea. He clearly raised the bar in song writing.	6
The medical profession is clueless according to three articles I just read. They have no idea how to treat obese or transgender people, among others, and doctors routinely act based on biases and stereotypes. For example, scales aren't calibrated or constructed to weigh obese people and medication dosage often doesn't take weight into account. Doctors just tell patients to lose weight and rush them out of the office. Not that the rest of us are protected from medical protocols that are outdated and sometimes harmful, either. What to do?	2
I feel very sad for the family of people who have lost their loved ones, especially family members that were so very deeply involved with the community and have touched so many hearts of the people around them as well. I am sure that for a long time, memories and special moments will be told with heart felt warmth for many generations.	0
I found a story about Kate Beckinsale and her husband, Len Wiseman, they have pulled the plug on their marriage ... TMZ has learned. Wiseman cited irreconcilable differences. His docs state both he and Kate have waived any right to spousal support, and that suggests there's a prenup. They were married in 2004 and have no kids together. TMZ broke the story ... the couple's marriage was on the rocks last November. Len was spotted out with model CJ Franco, and Kate we seen shortly after -- sans wedding ring -- on the red carpet.	1
Russia claims bombed UN aid convoy was 'escorted by terrorists A UN aid convoy that was bombed on Monday night was escorted by a "terrorists", Russia has claimed in response to accusations it was behind the deadly attacks. Moscow has denied hitting the UN convoy, which was bombed as it delivered food aid to opposition-held parts of Aleppo on Monday night, minutes after the military declared the end of a ceasefire. The strikes, carried out by either Syrian or allied Russian warplanes, hit Syrian Red Crescent trucks as staff members were unloading aid in Urem al-Kubra in Aleppo province. More than a dozen were killed including Omar Barakat, the organisation’s director. Pictures shared by activists showed burned bodies next to a UNHCR badge. Russia's defence ministry relea	1
Tourist who claimed she was raped in Dubai is charged with extramarital sex — A British tourist allegedly raped by two men in Dubai faces jail after cops accused her of sex outside marriage. The woman, 25, claims she was attacked by two U.K. men last month. But when she reported it, she was locked up and charged with “extramarital sex”. She is on bail but is not allowed to leave and needs $30,000 for legal fees.	1
I am writing to you in response to an article I just read about Nevada and the water supply. It is of a truth, as the article points out that the news media primarily only follows what happens in California, and not Nevada. Which is the driest State, and in need of attention and assistance. I'm impressed with Verna Brady, 86-year-old resident there. Who cites she would rather move forward, than behind, that she, although an elder with many childhood memories, would rather adapt to what's required for today, than harbor on what use to be. That's a large statement, because when it comes to tribes in America, a lot do not to be displaced, or relocation, creating emotional and psychological problems are the results. However the present state is also causing more abuse factors in the family.	6
I totally get this in a lot of ways. I used to roll my eyes at people who were frothing at the mouth over Obama being elected, and how they seemed to make grand statements of the world ending RIGHT NOW because a black man was in the white house. Now...I don't know. I see my friends and family freaking out and I want to tell them to just chill out. Obama didn't destroy America--the right wingers were wrong about that. Neither will Trump. Life will keep going. It brings a lot of stress listening to people freaking out all the time. And yet, I get it. I get why they are worried and freaking out. I don't like it either, but I don't get the point of stressing out so much. But then again, I've completely dissociated from all this. I don't really read the news anymore.	1
This article was quite interesting to me. It talked about the invention of a new male contraceptive. It talks about the potential side effects that steer men away from using the contraceptive. The writer of the article mocks men for avoiding these contraceptives when female contraceptives have way more side effects to them. I personally disagree with the writer - if male contraceptives were invented before female contraceptives, I believe that males would have no problem using them despite the side effects. What are your thoughts?	1
Did you hear about the shipwreck in Egypt? Unfortunately it looks like fifty five people have died. It's such a sad story. I feel so bad for the families and that has to be a odd feeling for the 150 or so that survived. So many people swam to save their lives. I would never be able to do that! There were also children on the boat, so that is incredibly sad. I hate that people died and had no chance of survival.	0
I think it's so rude when people mock government officials and get so full of them selves over politics. It really just burns me up that people can't get along in regards to it.  I hate reading about politics in general and it is even worse when you have to read about grown adults bickering  and arguing over it all.  Joe Walsh and Diana Duckworth both are very immature. What do you think?	3
I think lung cancer is not really caused too highly by air pollution. I feel that the number one pollutants that cause lung cancer is purely smoking.  Im glad I quit smoking years ago.  They say these scientific reports and studies provide that the air pollution caused early stage lung cancers, however I really just don't believe it.	1
I'm glad Germany is trying to help a lot of refugees when other countries (ahem the US) are trying to get out of helping people. However if they're going to have that reputation they need to be prepared to deal with the number of individuals who will try to come. It feels like so many of the problems these refugees are running from have been created at some point due to US/European colonization and intervention, so I'm glad they're at least trying.	3
Hello friends, I will take part in this group to tell you some important news. They know that I always read and look for information. Some time ago it seems that a man died at sea after he fell off the cruiser where he was going. The person's name was Bernardo García Teixeira. Now his partner filed a lawsuit with the Royal Caribbean company. The people of the cruise and the police also allege that this couple was discussing a moment before the accident happened.	1
Hello Friend how are you? How are your children behaving? I do not understand much about politics but now the President of this country and that of Ruisa joined forces when fighting against Syria. They called Syria as the first threat and classified it as terrorists. I really do not understand what is the reason for so much hearing and what was the initial problem.  I know that there are many good people in Syria, so it makes me think that many people died when the President of Russia bombed Syria. Many good people die. I consider that the war does not solve anything, it has not done it before and neither will it now.	3
As much as I love dogs I must say this was totally the owners fault.  The rule was the dog needed to be on a leash.  The woman did not follow the rules and the dog ran over to a stranger. The dog scared the stranger as is expected. I have had many big scary dogs running towards me and wasn't sure if it was going to attack me or be nice. The man got scared and shot the dog. Its sad but the man did not know if the dog was going to attack him.	2
I just read a very sad article on the elderly that are stuck in Aleppo, Syria due to the war there. Apparently, 200,000 people are unable to get out due to the government's siege of the area. There is a decreased access to food and resources for long term medical conditions are scarce. The elderly are having to sacrifice their well-being for the well-being of their children and grandchildren. The war needs to come to an end soon, before there is more suffering by the people of Syria.	0
And another shooting of a black man by a cop. While most of the time, I feel that the shooting is justified, with the evidence presented, I definitely think this needs to go to a jury for a decision. I agree that she should have been trained for this scenario, but no one knows exactly what their emotions will be in a situation like this one. It was a domestic violence call, which are extremely dangerous for police officers. But I don't understand why less than lethal methods weren't deployed first.	0
Man this news story is really crazy and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Just warning you that the content is kind of disturbing but it's so scary that things like this could happen to just anyone walking down the street! Feel free to share with anyone else in Australia; I hope that poor woman is okay.	2
I found this article and wanted to share it with you. Very disturbing and odd results from the 2016 presidential campaign demographics results. Very surprised to see so many Lantinos voting for a dude who is so blantly racist.I think all the Black people who voted for Trump are going to see that they were uninvited to the family barbecue next year as well XD	5
This guy that I just read about seriously cannot be trusted. He was going around acting like an apartment belonged to him when it did not in actuality. I wonder will he be punished sufficiently. I doubt it. He will probable just strike a deal and that will be the end of it. He needs to be publicly shamed.	4
The Japanese that made up the restriction stating that you could not apply makeup while on the train are completely out of line. It is not up to them to dictate whether a man or woman can use their commute time to apply makeup. There needs to be mass protests, but we know there will not be as it is not in their nature.	1
The gun issue in the United States of America is becoming a joke for the entire world to see play out. Apparently, as anyone can see, guns are causing more harm than good in all communities. Perhaps since this fatal shooting involved a cop with possible mental issues it will put the spotlight on both issues. I will not hold my breath though.	3
Terrorism has become so commonplace that it does not even alarm me anymore. It is simply just another day in the world that we have come to live in. No one really wants to address the reasons that drive people to terrorism, so I guess we will just continue to let the media sensationalize death and complain about it the next day.	1

The person was robbed the money at gun point and escaped from that place. The victim calls the 911 and the police investigation the victim and gathered some information about the criminal. Then they are start to search the criminal.The victim calls the 911 and the police investigation the victim and gathered some information about the robbery.	1
What this article taught me was that heartbreaks are not the end of the world. Yes, they are NOT. Just because that one precious person left us we start living with an emotion that our life has come to an end. Life isn't ending at all, each day is a new beginning, with new people waiting for us out there. As you move forward, life will remove many people from your life just because they aren't required and you can actually reach your destination. Your life has just begun, nobody stops moving, the sun still rises and the sun still sets.	1
What this also taught me is that I think poverty teaches you to value anything and everything you have .. importance of friends , importance of one time meal, importance of tiniest thing in your life .. It teaches you to survive on bare minimum. Poverty teaches gratitude.  Some of the most happy people in the world are those people who have the least.  When you aren't flooded with tons of material goods you can focus more on the simple things that you do have. Look at Brazil the have to struggle to eat but it's what keeps them humble.	1
What I learned about nature is that they cannot be predicted. Nature can look beautiful in one instance and can kill you in the next. Take a look at this shark incident. poor guy was play a game with some buddies and lost his life for no reason. Today you are here and tomorrow you are gone. Try to live as long as you possibly can before some shit comes along and tries to take it away.	1
I agree that this election is stressful. There seems to be a lot of tension between parties. People are worried about what could happen if Trump wins. I think all of the racists will come out of the woodwork. People won’t be comfortable. As a minority, I think things will feel different. People aren’t scared to post when behind a wall on social media.	2
I’m so tired of Republicans. They never compromise. They want it their way. They never meet in the middle or half way. The government is a joke and can’t get a thing done because of the divide in parties. Democrats are willing to meet in the middle but it doesn’t matter because conservatives will only have one way.	3
Global warming is really serious. Sometimes I think, is this a good time for having kids? I don't want my kids have a chaotic world, full of adversity and contamination. Also, I think my nation is in "control" for now, but future seem different. People now don't care about being correct and helpful to everyone, a lot of people is dishonest and disloyal. We need a society that we can trust. Our world is extremely corrupt, I think this can be change if we gave enough education to all generations since they are kids.	2
Thinking about water contamination is a scary thought. When that can effect our children it makes things even worse. The crisis in Flint is unacceptable and to hear about the drinking fountain in Chicago makes things even worse. It makes you think that major improvements need to made across the US. New laws need to be put in place to ensure everyone is getting healthy water.	2
This is horrible. Too have a disaster like this happen is sad. Other nations should do what we can in order to help. You never know when we may need the help for other countries. We know as a country how hard it is to loss everything to a natural disaster. All the lives lost it is best practice to help out.	0
This was terrible! I'm so glad that those guys got arrested. It's never okay to throw bottles at people, I don't care who you are or what the circumstances are. That poor kid almost died. I mean why? For nothing. Because of a stupid fan rivalry? What do you guys think? Agree or disagree? I can't see how you could take a different stance on it, but just for kicks and giggles. I mean I'm all for sports and stuff but if you get out of control and you hurt someone, that's on you. This is supposed to be fun. These games aren't supposed to be violent, and continued behavior along these lines could damage the reputation of the game, the fans, and the organization. I don't condone it at all and I don't think that you should either. So there you go, that's that. There you go. That's that. There.	4
This is so sad guys. :( I can't believe this, I never knew how far reaching climate change actually was. These poor turtles are dying because of the temperature changes. Please do something, write your local senator so we can start to reverse this. We need to get back into the climate accords and become a leader in environmental sustainability, instead of what we have been doing.	0
Trump is a completely terrible president. Don't you agree? He's done nothing for the country, it's no wonder that he's gone down so far in the polls. anyone who supports him better comment so I can unfriend you right now. It's ridiculous. If you support him, you support racism, homophobia, xenophobia, divisiveness, and hate.	3
I really didn't know Leonard Cohen that much growing up, only listen to a couple of his songs, wasn't a big fan but It's tragic that he died, to be fair its a good way to die at an old age and died while asleep, painless and nothing that hurts him. He also said that He was ready to die, so lets take that in for an account, that he was prepared to go. So he died peaceful.	0
I just read this article about how Canada actually had school where they would force indigenous people of their land to go.  They tried to erase their history , and their language.  I always thought canada was such a peaceful country.  These people were even experimented on, and the school was still in operation up until 1996!, That is astonishing.  I thought, we , americans, were the only ones who forced the indigenous people away, or tried to kill their culture.  This just shows you that people are pretty much the same, and pretty much were savages, until recently.  Even now though, we still have a long way to go, until we reach a place where everyones culture and differences are celebrated, and not shamed, and destroyed	5
I never read up much on Thailand, but it seems as if the place might change a lot in the near future.  The king died, and the queen is dying.  There is some shady general who is taking over now. The people of Thailand, loved their king, and he gave them a sense of stability, in a crazy political climate.  They mourned the former king for a month, and now the queens death, may follow very soon.  I am glad, though I never think about it, how lucky I am to be in a country with some "sense" of stability, and not ruled in constant flux.	1
Poor people, I feel bad for the family they left behind and for their friends and family, my deepest condolences to their relatives. It was an accident and there was nothing that could be done to preven it, but I hope this serves as lesson to other to be more careful while engaging in that kind of activities.	0
As I was reading our local newspaper last night, my eyes came to rest on several reports of yet another handful of the farm attacks and -murders South Africa has become known for over the past years.  Farm attacks and -murders which see journalists having to write these reports with words I cannot even begin to imagine the sickening feeling of. Words like “boiling water poured down 87-year-old farmer’s throat for hours on end,” and “his wife and two teenage daughters were tied with barbed wire in the bathroom, after which they were repeatedly raped, burned with a hot iron, and stabbed with a sharp object.”	1
I'd like to say that a comedy of errors has taken place.  It seems our friend Gil got himself into trouble without doing anything wrong.  His identity was stolen and then later he was mistakenly identified as the wrong person. Society needs to do a better job of providing enough resources for the "accused" to ensure that the perpetrator doesn't get a free ride while the accused seems to lose everything.    We do live in a society where supposedly you are innocent till proven guilty, right?  How can one lose a drivers license and a job without 100% proof on the table?  Technology should be brought to bear to ensure that everyone is held harmless till all the facts are in. Is this achievable in our time?  I believe yes if the right companies and government assets are brought in early enough.	0
It is a sad world when lives are threatened daily.  let's remember when we here in America were fighting each other during the civil war.  war is hell whether you are on the "right" side or the "wrong" side.  Both sides invariably lose something.    Does it make sense to have war?  Is it a human condition that we will never be able to contain?  I know these are open ended questions but are we like the herds of animals that migrate and take over others' territories when food and water are needed.   I believe we can be better by accepting our differences and finding common ground for the welfare of all.	0
So what can we do when genocide occurs in different parts of the world?  Does prayer help? Will war help or hurt more?  When people do not get along, not because of a shortage of food or water, but rather because a belief system is not universal, that is a human tragedy.   Saudi Arabia and Iran are prime examples of animalistic behavior at this point in time.    We here in America pretty much  killed off the American Indians because we wanted the land.  Nothing different is happening in the Middle East.  We always hear that might makes right but that's not truly the case.  Might makes blight and generations suffer till most of it is forgotten.  The moral is too  learn from our mistakes and the bad aspects of what history tries to teach us .	0
I can't believe what I just read. I read this article about how riot police took down some pipeline protestors in North Dakota. The armed police used such violent and aggressive tactics to take down the protestors. The protestors were Native Americans and environmental activists. Being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would react to being treated this way. They used sonic devices and rubber bullets shooting the protestors in the face. I'm outraged by these actions. This is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct. The cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local's water supply. I don't blame them for protesting one bit. The actions and the engagement by the riot police of North Dakota was shameful and they should be punished.	4
I can not believe Canada took so many native people and put them in their "proper" schools. They took away their language and their heritage. And on top of all that 6000 died! Plus many were abused! This is horrible! I am so upset by this! I mean seriously? How could they do that! And the worst part is that was still going on all the way up to 1996!!! That is insane! And they only apologized in 2008. Way too late. I mean the harm they did to these children is massive. They need to make up for what they have done!	3
I had no clue Oklahoma was getting so many earthquakes lately. Apparently due to the oil companies injecting waste it is triggering a lot more earthquakes. They aren't  massive ones, but still 5.0 is decent. It caused some damage to buildings and stuff. People even at the oil company felt it really well. It shook everyone up a good bit. But its crazy that its becoming the norm there! So crazy.	5
Hey, Zambia is protecting elephants on a massie refuge type area! They are fighting off poaching and that sort of stuff. Which is great! But I had no idea that the elephants are destroying a lot around the. They have even killed people! Sad huh? Also elephants will wipe out a farmers entire plants and food! That is really bad. They feel like their government care more about the animals than the people! I think they should provide some fencing. That is ridiculous to let people suffer all because they won't put up some barriers to block the elephants.	6
There are so many instances of shootings and mass murdering happening around the world today and the example brought up in the article like the Orlando shooting just shows how there is a culture these days where people just don't care anymore. More and more people find it okay to take the lives of innocent people for their own screwed up agenda, whatever that is so that they can show that they have control over the situation. I think a huge problem here is gun laws and there should definitely be some sort of change that occurs.	1
I feel like the shipwreck amongst other violence that occurred in this article is pretty sad. Like other articles that I have read, it seems like there is just so much death occurring and there is not too much coverage over it. The amount that we do see don't seem to even scratch the surface as there are many other acts of violence and events that occur that take the lives of many other people from places like third world countries that don't even get broadcasted at all. Sad to see that our world is slowly spiraling into this chaos that just continues to grow.	0
I think parents complaining about their preteen children are overreacting.  Just deal with it and everything will be okay.  You can't place them in a toy box anymore or sit them in front of the TV and tell them to sit and watch it until it's done.  I'm not worried about this because I have no kids of my own and I could care less.	3
In this Food, water fears remain year after Brazil mine dam disaster — COLATINA, Brazil — One year after a dam ruptured and sent a giant wave of metal-laden mud gushing into one of Brazil’s most important rivers, people who live along the banks won’t drink the water and fishermen are afraid to eat their catch. Upward of 10 billion gallons of mud filled with mining waste buried towns in the Nov. 5 dam break that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in Latin America’s largest country. Nineteen people perished. Across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of New York City’s Central Park — the onslaught of mud crushed thousands of trees and wildlife. In the river, more than 14 tons of fish died, mostly after mud got stuck in their gills.This equally large amount of  aquatic.	2
This is a very interesting article that focuses on this woman jet pilot, she was one of a kind. her heroic acts were recognized by those who knew  her. the author portrays her as a hero and someone who should be remembered. once you finish reading this article you'll understand lots of things you did not before	6
so i just read this article, a very interesting one. you all need to read it to understand what it is really about. there is a way the author puts things in a very simple way for everyone to understand. i would encourage you all to find it and read it. it will be worth your time.	6
I feel so bad for Val, he is battling this disease and people are dwelling on the fact he may die soon. I think Douglas cares for Val,however,he should not make public comments regarding Val's condition, that is very intrusive to Val, and I feel anger towards Michael for being so rude and invading towards Val's condition.	0
See? This is why sometimes I rather ignore the news. Shootings over there, people dead over here, drugs, etc. It makes me sick the kind of world we live in. Hundreds of deaths just because they thought these people were related to drug dealing? I mean, did they even had some kind of proof? Why shoot to kill? Why not stick to the laws and put them in jail if they were found guilty?	4
This is one of those articles that can really make you feel paranoid. Like, what if suddenly there is a red squirrel in my backyard and it has this sickness? And now I might have it. You know? Stuff like that. In the other hand, it just shows how little we know of these world. Of the illness, the animals, how it affects us. So much to discover	2
Despite our best efforts, it really is nearly impossible to keep our children and families from the cruel nature of the world. Even something like a vacation to another country or a trip to watch fireworks can result in tragedy that leaves everlasting scars. This is a world we want to avoid, but find ourselves surrounded by almost always.	0
Wildfires in the western area of North Carolina, in the Appalachian mountains, can get so large they can be seen from space. In fact, some of the wildfires in neighboring southern states can produce enough smoke to cover areas of South Carolina. Despite not actually having a fire there, the smoke can get so thick that it takes heavy rain to make it dissipate.	1
This bsi truly disturbing, I don't understand how someone could ever do that to an animal let alone a small kitten. There are truly some very disturbed peopel on this planet and the person who did this should be punished severely. This si not an act of violence it is an act of malice. The person who did this will go on to do other terrible things in the futurw	3
Even though Donald trump condemns these actions by his supporters it doesn't stop the fact that he incites this sort of behavior with his comments and his proposed laws. Trumps supporters, well a decent majority love his call of racism and bigotry. It is bno surpise that his supporters are the epitomy of racisma nd there behavior is not surpring.	3
Hate seems to be increasing in this country. I just read an article that hate crimes are going up. I don't know what's going on but people can't seem to handle themselves and use restraint. People are becoming too short-fused and trigger happy on attacking others with hate crimes. I hope things get better but the article didn't seem too optimistic. I guess the more we talk about this kind of stuff the better so it doesn't get ignored. It's an important issue.	3
In Moldovan, the lady running for president is being discriminated against in a very public way. They are saying just because she's not married, she is unqualified to lead the country. They care more about her personal business than her politics. It's a shame they are acting so backwards toward her. It makes me want to cheer for her just to spite them. I hope the rest of the world catches up to the idea everyone should be treated equally.	3
This is such a sad way for this actor to have to go. He contributed so much to his field, and he deserves a smooth, peaceful exit to life. I really hope that he and his friends and family will be okay. I know that it can be incredibly hard on the family to deal with these types of diseases and physical issues. Wishing them all the best.	0
I think these people ahve been fighting each other over tribalism and ideology since I can remember. Im talking about Iraq, which is dividing into 3 main groups who have competed for limited resources for a long time. And the wealth of oil taken by the leaders and not shared with prosperity for all people has increased tensions. When I was young it was Iraq Iran War, the Saddam Hussein reign of terror, then the First Gulf War, the the Second Iraq War, then ISIS. THese people have something wrong with them and I think they bear some responsibility for their own suffering.	1
I never knew there was a link between depression and birth control pills. I thought it would do the opposite because it allows women to have a full sex like without worrying about pregnancy, so they and their partners can feel more relaxed and open to exploring their sexuality. But now that i read the article I can see the link between hormone fluctuations and mood disorders since the two effect each other.	5
Hi! What do you think of this? I know you hate the pipeline as much as I do. Wonder if this would have a chance of working? We all know money is more important than human life, unfortunately. I'm skeptical, but then again, nothing has worked so far, so why would this? I don't know what to think. I don't have any actions I could take at this point, anyway.	3
Supposedly there is a lot of unrest in Ethiopia right now over the appropriation of land and government protest. I thought they were doing well and the economy was growing but i guess it has ceased now. Its unbelievable that all this is going on and most people in the states are aware of whats going on.	1
I have very little sympathy for Turkey, it's a country that has been playing every sides of the field it can for a long time. It is so split, because of this. I feel for the people, and that's why there are so many split groups, not counting outside terrorist groups trying to gain influence in the area. I feel nothing for the country, only the people.	0
Knowing how you love animals, I thought you would like to read about the Four Paws removal of the surviving animals in a Gaza Strip zoo. First of all, the zoo was horrid. Less than 20 animals remained of the hundreds that had been previously housed here. The rescue of the animals occurred under rather harrowing conditions with Hamas and Israeli forces launching missles during the evacuation process. It sounds as though the surviving animals will end up in different locations that deal with their specific species. They will be rehabilitated and may eventually be released back into the wild. Let me know what you think.	0
The liberal left has struck again. They continue to react negatively to Trump being president even 18 months after the election. This whole thing about getting an IUD now because Trump will make birth control unaffordable in the near future is ridiculous. Just another issue to get people stirred up. Most Trump supporters are conservative when it comes to economic issues but moderately liberal when it concerns social issues. Big changes in birth control, same sex marriages, abortion, and women’s rights are not going to happen. I would like to ask the haters how their lives have changed for the worse since the election!	3
Hey, did you know that Turtles are especially endangered because of people using them for food, exploiting them by selling and trading them, and they are dying because of pollution and damage to rivers and Lakes.. their resources and dwindling.  The real worry isn't so much the problem with Global warming..they can stand that somewhat..the problem is we are damaging the planet and fresh water so rapidly they can not withstand it.   More than 60 percent of Turtles and their Shelled brothers are in danger.. they are vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered.  We should do something to stop this.  These creatures sometimes live longer than us.  How is it that we are allowing them to be maimed, eaten, and polluting their habitat??  We have to do better.  What do you say we volunteer tog	1
Wow.. You have to check this out.  There was a horrible accident on a family type Water Ride in Gold Coast Austrailia.  4 People were killed..2 women ages 42 and 32 I think, also two men, 38, and 35,.  This is what happened...2 people were ejected from the raft and the other 2 were trapped inside..they all died.  The park was shut down.  The thing that makes it wierd is that the water feature is like a tame family type ride..Definately things families would go on together. Makes you think Right?	5
President Trump is so stupid for pulling out of the Paris deal. Being that our Country is held highly among-st the rest of the world, you would think that we would be considered with the environment just as much as everyone else. How can he believe Climate Change isn't real How is he allowed to just pull us from this deal we agreed to? It seems pretty stupid to me that he can just make these changes on his own free will. What happens later down the road when the impact of these decisions are felt and the earth really does have an Angry Summer?	3
I hate it when these terrorist attacks happen on innocent people who are just living their lives. I don't know how open societies can completely eliminate them? You can't put the terrorist stigma on everyone of a certain religion and you can't close off your society. There's always going to be religious zealots and crazy people who feel violence is the only way to get their ideas across, but we just have to keep fighting them and trying our best to prevent an attack when possible.	3
I can't stand these Jenners and Kardashians. But I have to give them credit for making a living from doing nothing. I guess that is the new American Dream! THey are producing a product that people want to consume. Isn't that sick? The crazy thing is that this family is going to become the normal and accepted family environment.	4
I feel horrible that this is happening. It probably a lot to do with what America has done in that country. They are the ones who armed the rebels and caused this problem. America created the terrorists groups. I know I am not responsible but it makes me sick to know that intelligence agencies from our own countries instigated this problem. I feel sympathy for all those who have been killed and the families who's lives have been ruined.	0
This article is very tiring. I am tired of hearing about the corruption of politicians. There does not seem to be a single good moral politician. It would be impossible to win and position of public office without corruption. This is just another example of more corruption. Why do the biggest low lifes decide to be poloticians? Maybe because they are the type of people that like to lie and cheat there way to money and power.	3
I feel sad yet again to here about more crimes against the native americans. The pipeline is disgusting and will no doubt result in leaks that contaminate water. It is good that people are protesting but I don't feel it will end up working. There is oil there and they will kill people if they need to just like they do in every other country.	0

Michael Moore to Democrats: I told you Trump was going to win — On Wednesday, filmmaker and activist Michael Moore penned a "Morning After To-Do List" for Democrats that has, as of Thursday morning, been shared more than 180,000 times, liked more than 350,000 times, and commented on more than 18,000 times. Moore also says Democrats must fire the pundits, pollsters, and members of the media who refused to let go of a narrative about the election that proved to be incorrect, force aside any Democratic members of Congress who aren't ready to fight, and remind everyone they meet that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. His No. 4 item, however, might come as a surprise to Democrats who are posting their own status updates on social media about how "shocked" or "stunned" they are at this outco	1
Lydia Jones, a spokeswoman for BAFTA Cymru, said Friday that the organization had been told there would be no further details on Mr. Jones’s condition. Primary progressive aphasia is a rare nervous system syndrome that affects a person’s ability to express his or her thoughts and understanding, or to find words, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms begin gradually, often before age 65, and worsen over time. The news of the diagnosis was also reported by the BBC and Britain’sNational Press Association. The announcement of Mr. Jones’s illness dominated Monty Python fan siteson Friday, where it was described as “sad” and “terrible” news. Eric Idle, a co-founder of the ribald, outrageous and internationally acclaimed British troupe, tweeted thanks to fans for their support while noting Mr.	0
This is such a terrible thing to happen to so many people. I wonder how a town can meaningfully bounce back and rebuild their lives. I don't know what I would do if this happened to me. Move? Work on recreating the city? Turn to the government for hope? It just seems so overwhelming and impossible. I feel so grateful to have avoided such an experience. I wonder if there is anything I can do to help.	0

This was a tough article to read because if you put yourself in that place, and you think of yourself losing a friend that is very close to you or a family friend. I know that whenever I think about not having someone that has been close to me I wonder how I would feel or react. I don't think that we let people know how we feel enough.	0
I think that this is a kind of funny story. I enjoy hearing about escaped animals from the zoo for some reason. If you think about it the zoo is just one big animal jail. I am sure that I would resent the fact of being locked up if I was a wild animal. Some of these animals have never known the difference.	6
Mosul is Iraq's second most populous city.a major military campaign launched by the Iraqi Government forces with allied militias, The intensity of the fighting and the airstrikes in eastern parts of the city is high many people are killed their bodies hang in the middle cities not giving to the resident. The coalition strategy was reported to be to encircle Mosul completely, after which Iraqi troops would advance into the city-center. Pro-government fighters in the south of Mosul were battling pockets of ISIL fighters and snipers as they tried to reclaim the village of Abbasi.	1

You know I love playing devil's advocate and having random views on things. Well here's another one of my crazy ideas so prepare yourself. I think that the Mayor of Sacramento is blessed that's all that happened to him. Yes he may be upset and a little shaken, but he still gets to go home to his family and enjoy his wealth. He doesn't lose his job and he isn't majorly damaged. I would easily take a pie in the face if afterwards I was a rich white man who still had supporters behind me.	1
As I read this article, I felt a bit nervous and alarmed at India's tiger population, even though this is in India but still. Hopefully, the Tigers will be better protected in the future and people will stop trying to kill them or dial it down at least. I wish India's tigers the best in their protection and survival.	2
Check out this article about the zika virus. I did not know that there was so much going on with it, or that it spread so much. I also did not know that it can spread through the ways they described in the article, like sex. Definitely information we need to know Make sure to read up on this and be careful!	2
I'm glad I don't wear contacts, because I'm so lazy with them that I would likely become infected and that would be horrible for my already terrible eyes. I read an article that said that people who leave their contacts in while they sleep are more likely to get an eye infection that can cause blindness. Makes me wish I could fix my vision to perfection again. I hate that I have terrible eyesight and have to rely on primitive glasses or risky contacts. It's not  fair and I am very upset about it. Does anyone want to donate their eyes to me? I promise I will take good care of them. If only I could grow new eyes or get badass bionic cyborg eyes that can shoot lasers, then i could defeat the bacteria and be a hero to the human race. Well that's all silly pipedreams. I just have to deal withit	0

People are up in arms over Trump not believing in climate change.  Withdrawing from the Paris treaty supposedly will contribute to global warming, along with doing away with the clean air act Obama passed while in office.  There's so much involved with climate change its hard to tell what is fact.  States are taking measures into their own hands to the extent they can I guess.	1
While the article seems to be slightly sympathetic to the inmates, I say no way. I don't particularly care what happens to most prisoners, let alone the violent ones that attack each other and guards. There is no reason why any guard should ever have to put themselves in danger. These aren't people, these are violent animals, and the guards should be protected. They aren't the ones being punished for what is likely a severe wrongdoing. Restraints, solitary, whatever it takes, I don't feel one tiny twinge of sadness. And lawsuits? Don't even get me started on that one!	3
Wow, killing someone in public? That takes some serious nerve. I don't particularly know whether she is guilty or not, but for it to be played out in the media isn't fair. While they may not have the same protections that the accused have in the United States, they should still give her a new trial, something quiet, out of the public eye, maybe even outside of the country, where she can get a fair trial based on the facts. If there is video of her spiking the coffee, or any indication that she has had any contact with cyanide, then I say she should get a retrial.	3
This is an extremely sad story The civilians who lost their did nothing wrong. They did not ask for this war to come to their region. They were mere victims of the misfortune of being born where they were and being where they were when they were. They were no more guilty than you or I. It is extremely sad and disappoints me as an American.	0
The eyes are a part of our body we definitely take for granted. At the same time, they are extremely important and truly open our vision to the world. It would be devastating for a young person to suffer an eye injury simply playing a sport. People should be extremely vigilant to prepare children to play such sports and avoid suffering any life altering injuries.	2
The thought of suffering from sleep paralysis is quite unnerving. It would seemingly be akin being a prisoner in one's own body. I would encourage anyone suffering from such issues to have such an issue investigated by a doctor. It is very fortunate that we live in a time where doctors can assist individuals with such issues, so people should really seek help.	2
I feel like there is so many people out there that are less fortunate then us, we need to take a second to see how people feel about themselves and the situations they are in and the people around them. I feel like the person writing this has gone through alot in his life and this all just adds into the fact of everything else	0
I would feel absolutely horrible to be in any of these parents shoes, I feel like they probably think they are completely lost, anxious, deserted. I would be a complete mess. I dont know exactly what i would do in that situation. I feel like the chaces are good neough for them to try for that second baby but i do inderstand them not wanting to rry because of the small chances of the other one having the zika virus anyways.	0
I never knew that bananas were at risk of becoming extinct. Apparently we need to cultivate more varieties, so we do not face another crisis like Cavendish and Big Mike bananas that have succumbed to a fungal disease and almost got wiped out. We are so used to seeing bananas as a common fruit at supermarkets that we never think of not ever eating another one again! I found this article very intriguing, there is so much work that goes into figuring out how to protect this yellow fruit from fungal illnesses and make it more resistant to various dangerous fungal strains.Apparently this presents a great challenge for the scientists but they are hoping to cultivate more banana plant varieties that will be more resistant to various illness.	5
While I do sympathize with the plight of back people and latest police violence, I think that they are not helping the situation by engaging in violent protests that take even more lives and create a great deal of disturbance in USA! These protests ignite racial tensions but will not bring back the lives of innocent victims. What needs to be done here is clamping tight on the police force-punishing them appropriately and in the harshest of form if they take an innocent life or harass black people for no reason! They need to undergo training and psychological evaluation before being allowed to go out there and deal with criminals! They need to be psychologically stable and clear of racial bias, otherwise they are not suitable for this job!	3
Hi N. Just wanting to talk to somebody and you as always you are the right person to reach to. I just read an article on the Matthew and the destruction it left in Haiti. I was overwhelmed and I almost cannot believe how many people were affected and not just that but they were suffering from all kinds of unimaginable things. Hunger was the first to list, there was a lot a starvation, people were poring from all over when aid was coming to bring them food aid with trucks. Disease was everywhere, doctors coming from all over the world had to face with cholera and disease. Infrastructure was damaged, homes destroyed. It is really hard to express in words all the suffering the people had to deal with. I feel like there should be something we should do to help.	0
Just wanting to let you know about a news story I came across. It is about an elephant, named Nosey. He is been owned by a guy and held in chains. He used Nosey to perform for public entertainment in circuses and forced for most of her life to give rides to adults and children  across the United States. Oh, and she has been in solitary for almost 30 years, that is a lifetime. Being captive  for such a long period caused major stress to her health as well as to her psychological well being. The owner has been cited numerous times but in the same time his license was still approved for renewal each year. There should be awareness for this abuse to stop.	0
Just came across an article that involves shootings and people being killed. The story is about a white person in his 50's if I am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud music that was playing in a Durango by some black teenagers at a gas station in Florida. There was an argument regarding the music and some exchange of words. The white guy shot the 17 year old black kid 6 times. He was convicted for life with the possibility of parole after 2 years. He was denied. These situations are complicated and they are happening quite often lately. There should be a limit on many things, and one of them should be the guns. There should be a stricter gun control .	1
Hey I thought you'd be interested in this article I just read about the complications associated with contact lenses. I know you were considering allowing Mary to get contacts instead of her glasses this year. It seems that complications can range from microbial infections to complete blindness! Interestly, the CDC notes that there are less incidents with the disposable lenses. Have you considered them at all?	2
Although coal kils I did learn that coal is important for baseload energy generation, coal plants are safe and easy to maintain and the fuel can easily be transported and the residue disposed of. Coal (with varying qualities) is an abundant resource, available to many countries within their borders. Uranium on the other hand requires a lot more work and safety precautions before reaching a point where it can be used as nuclear fuel.India is unfortunate as usual to be on the short end of the stick.	0
I just read an article about two US Military personals being shot in Jordan. I have so many emotions running through me. I am sad about the loss of lives. I am in disbelief. How could this happen? The article said they do not believe it was a terrosit attack so that makes me feel relieved, but still worried. US is there to assist Jordan for training. Why our are people being attacked?! The article said they failed to stop at the entrance so I do not know if maybe it was a miscommunication. I am confused to what actually happened. From what I read there was an attack on Jordan when they just drove and barralled through their border so they are on high alert. My heart goes out to all of those involved and I am sad. But why on earth would they think that the US military personal are planning	0
rember when Kim Kardashian was attacked in Paris? I just read another famous person, Mallika Sherawat was tear gassed and beaten :( It is so sad you can not feel safe anywhere! I am glad she is outspoken and is bringing awareness to this whole ordeal. I feel so bad for all these people just minding their own business and being attacked.	0
Hello there, I think this situation in Haiti needs our attention. It's clear that these people are suffering after such a catastrophe befell them. I urge you to donate and make a difference in these people's lives especially the children who are suffering and don't have anything to eat. Every dollar will count I think	0
Hello there. I just read this story about a cop who killed a totally unarmed black man and I think it is disgusting. The police has been very biased against blacks lately and this is just another example of how bad things have gotten. I think this cop needs to be sentenced severely so that all other cops can also refrain from doing the same	3
Hey buddy. I think this article made me worried about this Zika situation. It is spreading with such vigor like never before and it kills very fast. I think the whole world needs to be on alert and health scientists need to be working hard to try and eradicate this disease. It's gonna take some time but something needs to be done	2
Heyy! Although this story is sad, I found it definitely alarming and should serve as an example on how this obsession with selfies needs to stop. Apparently, a guy was killed by a python because he was trying to take a good selfie. I think he was one of those people who like to take selfies doing something daring	0
Kind of cool that researchers  have found that bonobos tend to become farsighted as they age, which is quite similar to humans. They also observed their grooming practices. Some even take turns grooming one another, which is pretty cool. The article was extremely hard to read and understand, especially with it being written in one giant block, so those are really the only key points I got from it.	6
Is Val Kilmer healthy or not? Seems as though comments keep being made about his health and now Michael Douglas has even said something about him. Although, just because the two worked together on The Ghost and the Darkness (one of the best movies ever!) doesn't give him the right to make public comments about Kilmer's health whether it's true or not. Maybe he doesn't want the whole world to know if he's going through something.	1
I just read about this Australian hiker that was lost in the Malaysian jungle for two weeks and most of that time without food. He was week but he survived. I'm shocked. I'm happy he made it because to often you hear those stories of a lost hiker and it ends tragically. His friends and family say he has a strong mental attitude, he must. I don't think I'd ever survive that long especially since I don't even know anything about safe plants to eat like this guy must have. Way to go sir. Way to fight.	5
hey . have u heard about the accident where a fuel tank exploded and around 75 people where burned to death and many more are injured . what a world we live in where people for some profit put their life in danger as well as other . this make me sick to my core . who going to take responsibility for all that life lost and uncomfortable	3

Friends and family, this is another tragic incident.  This involves a troubled boy who was literally body slammed by a teacher.  He then was rushed to the hospital but they could not do much for him even through all of their best efforts.  In the end he had to have his leg removed.  This is tragic and we should seek justice for this child!	0
Friends and Family - we need to lobby for president Trump to take global warming more seriously.  As predicted, the temperature may rise in the near future by one point five degrees Celsius.  This will drastically change our weather and therefore cause disastrous effects to many, many places around the world.  This can all be stopped though if we get on board now!	2
I heard about a rock climber who died in Vietnam trying to scale it's highest mountain.  I remember we've talked about going on vacation there.  Sadly it was a young guy, 22, not much younger than us.  It's a really tragic story because he was on the trip with his girlfriend and when it went off on his own he became lost.  In his final moments they were actually in contact through texting.	0
Did you hear about this sexual harassment scandal involving the National Parks Service?  I guess there really is no industry that is immune to this misbehavior.  Incidents have been documenting going back decades but nothing was done about it.  It's really outrageous what people in power can get away with.	3
I don't know if you ever owned or read a copy of National Geographic magazine but there is something interesting that has occurred in the news lately.  It appears that the little Afghan girl, who was made famous on one of their covers, was arrested for trying to cross into Pakistan.  She was trying to enter as an unregistered immigrant instead of a refugee.  The Pakistan government wants to have her arrested.  I mean afterall, she's just trying to do what's best for herself by escaping a land that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans.  I'm not sure if even the UN can provide her the assistance she needs.  What it really comes down to is a matter of trying to get out of a bad situation in favor of one that is much more promising.  I really think this is unfair to me.	2
Dear friend ,  How are you ? I heard that you fell down the stairs and broke your leg !! Are you ok ? Hope you are getting better . But seriously, what really happened ? Your mum told me that you were running and fell  but I want to hear directly from you . I am coming to the hospital to visit you in an hour . That's my final decision. No one can change it , and yes because you didn't come to school today you missed a lot of work . Don't be too happy , you'll have to complete the work later	6
Expert from an article I just read on the climate talks:  "Mediterranean region would see changes never experienced during recorded history. Morocco could see increased temperatures and drought that would drive the southern deserts further north, displacing forests. Deserts would expand in the Middle East, pushing temperate forests higher into the mountains. Average temperatures in the region have already risen by 1.3°C since the late 19th century, well above the world average of 0.85°C, according to the study."  And we are still arguing over coal as a fuel source so that the billionaires can make more billions. Read the rest, it's distrubing what will come to those who suffer through what has been created.	2
Now this is a major issue:  "Why Do Obese Patients Get Worse Care? Many Doctors Don’t See Past the Fat — You must lose weight, a doctor told Sarah Bramblette, advising a 1,200-calorie-a-day diet. But Ms. Bramblette had a basic question: How much do I weigh? The doctor’s scale went up to 350 pounds, and she was heavier than that. If she did not know the number, how would she know if the diet was working?"  A populace that is so uneducated on health and nutrition that they don't know that it's mathematically impossible not to lose weight at over 350 pounds on a 1200 calorie a day diet. What's worse is a doctor who is so incompetent that he can't tell her that. If your clothes get bigger you are losing weight.	3
Nicolas Maduro is the current leader of Venezuela and it has led to major issues and divide in the country. The country is pretty much tyrannical at this point and the government is over-reaching into everyone's lives. Reading about the protests and issues going on makes me feel grateful to be out of that country. I really hope the people can oust him and replace it with a better government.	3
It's truly awful anytime some sick minded individual decides to take the life of others for literally no reason other than just to do it. Arcan Cetin was believed to be the one who shot up a maul and killed numerous people. It really is alarming at what goes wrong in these people's lives that makes them do such thing.	4
This is sad that a company that is based here in the US and that actually manafucters its products in the US is in debt. More effort should have been placed to ensure company's success. More companies should be encouraged to manufacture their products in our country while also making them affordable and appealing.	0
I think protests these days are getting out of hand. It's one thing if people want to protest peacefully, but it's another if they are damaging property and being aggressive and dangerous. I believe people should have a right to protest, but some laws must be in place. If you can't follow them there will need to be consequences.	3
There has been a lot of fires that are happening in the south.  Many people are being told that they have to wear special masks if they want to go outside because of the smoke from the fires.  People are also investigating to see what really caused the fire many people are suspecting that it's arson that is causing a lot of these fires to happen.  A lot of organizations are asking people to donate water and drinks for the firefighters to quench their thirst while fighting fires.  It truly is a sad thing and hopefully this problem will be resolved sooner than later.	0
I read an article about making the ivory trade legal, and it said it could cause the extinction of elephants. I find it extremely disturbing, since I can't imagine elephants being extinct. It makes me really angry that poachers are able to kill so many elephants, and that even if it's legal to trade ivory, the demand is still really high. I think finding a substitute for ivory is a better choice. No one actually needs ivory, and keeping it illegal seems like a better idea.	3
Check out this article. I wonder someday when all of these theoretic articles will change how things are done? Should we be doing massive changes in the way our government works, the way people are allowed to function? the products we are able to buy and the activities we are allowed to partake in? Will private jets disappear?	1
Hey check this out, you are a big Leonard Cohen fan right? This is sad, but this is life. I often think about the deaths of old people, should we be sad? should we celebrate their life? What is the appropriate emotion to experience at this point. I know I was sad when my two grand fathers died, but that is personal.	0
Hey did you check out the latest dram between Scottie Pippen and his wife Larsa? Maybe it is dumb but I care about these thing because I am from Chicago. I have been hearing the name Scottie Pippen on a regular basis for the last 25 years and it kind of makes you feel interested in that person's life. I know fi this was about Michael Jordan I would feel the same way.	1
Did you read this article? it is awful. Every time i hear about a murder suicide type situation I wonder where someone could have intervened, some doctor, some professional, some family member, who could have have done something to step in so that these people could be alive today? It will drive you crazy if you keep thinking about it.	0
It's scary to think that even somebody who is as well known and guarded as Kim Kardashian can still be the victim of crimes like this. It's got to be disheartening to be Kim and know you've spent (most likely) a lot of money to have security with you at all times to protect you from things like this, yet it still happens to you. You'd have to wonder just how much more one can do to protect themselves.	2
I don't know what more it's gonna take for meat eaters to finally get it through their heads that we consume way too much meat. If someone says "plant based" anywhere near them they seem to automatically reject it. Agriculture is the main contributor to the destruction of the earth. It's not like people are preaching everyone go vegan, but drastically reducing your intake of meat would help the planet by a huge margin. For whatever reason, they just can't seem to rationalize that simple sentiment.	3
Oh my god... I can't even imagine the fear those two poor boys must have felt.  I can only hope they did not see it coming.  How disturbed must one be to see this sort of thing as the only way out, the right thing to do?  The pain and loss this family is feeling is probably only compounded due to the conflicting feelings of someone you love committing such an atrocious act on others you love, whose lives were just beginning.  Poor babies... I do hope they didn't suffer.  It shows that complaints of domestic issues should be taken seriously, by everyone.  It states he was under investigation/being sought for domestic violations.  How did he even get his hands on those boys?  It's so sad.	0
What a terrible tragedy!  Accidents like this hit families so hard... and losing both a father and son this way!  The poor family must be just beside themselves.  It seems too, if one looks at the circumstances, that they were close and enjoyed doing things together.  How very sad.  The rest of the family must be just shaken to the core.  Hopefully they are a tight knit group with support systems.  I hate to hear about anyone in accidents, but this sort of thing is just too sad.	0
The fact that so many people still die of smoking deaths is unbelievable. With so much knowledge these days we should be able to educate people about the danger associated with smoking and change this pattern! And the fact that the WHO recommends taxation at 75 percent of retail cost and NO states do this is crazy!	5
There has been more fighting from the Saudis in nearby Yemen.  The United States continues to supply the Saudis with weapons and intelligence, despite the atrocious use they will be put to.  These war crimes seem to be increasingly commonplace, yet the US continues to pursue the almighty dollar in supporting Saudi Arabia.	3
Climate change isn't just about affect the weather negatively for future generations. It apparently will also affect food sources. We may be able to overcome this with our technology and science but will our food turn into frankenfood that could potentially have long term side effects that cannot be seen yet? Underdeveloped countries are especially going to be affected by diminishing crops due to climate change.	2
Big businesses should really be held accountable for where the bailouts they receive really go. Yet the government don't really enforce any rules. Just here is money and trust them to use it as it was intended for them. We really should stop corporate lobbying in Congress. Look at these people using the bailout money just for luxury. I am outraged!	3
I just read the article on the oil spill.  Even though I do agree with oil digging, when things go wrong, it does have severe consequences.  I feel mostly bad for the birds and sea life, which will obviously be affected.  You would think with all the money these oil companies profit from, they would take more safety precautions, in trying to avoid accidents from happening.  I know the industry creates a lot of jobs and most often, nothing goes wrong.  But when it does, it can be catastrophic for the wildlife in the area and those that live in the area.  Or even those areas that rely on tourism, if people can’t go into the oceans or there is oil spilling onto their beaches.  Not sure what the answer is, or if there even is an answer to it.  It just makes me sad to see those beautiful birds	0
These actresses and actors have tons of money.  If they really wanted to do the right thing, they certainly could, for their only son.  They are just selfish people, wanting what they want and unwilling to compromise with each other.  Most actors and actresses are like that.  They are so self-centered.  I can’t stand people like that.  I feel sorry for the poor kid.  Although he will probably grow up to be a self-absorbed, selfish brat, just like his parents.  I swear that I think the less people have, the better off they treat their children and their families.  I have no sympathy for people like these rich snobby people.  They probably have their own jets, tons of money.  Yet, they still can’t compromise.  I wish people like this would get a grip and I wish the media would stop reporting	3
I can't believe what's going on overseas. It's so tragic that people in the military are still dying in war, and for what? I thought they would be gone from there by now but they're not. And there's still issues with kidnappings and things of that nature. It's really quite shocking when you think about it.	5
It seems that climate change is still a big threat to animals and wildlife, but not necessarily in the ways we would first think of. Climate change can affect the habitats of wild animals and cause them to die from things like lack of water, which is still a big deal. It's not the temperature change necessarily but what happens to things like the habitat.	1
Male models are paid a lot less than female models, which is interesting considering all of the news lately about a "wage gap" that some people believe exists. Each industry has a different set of pay and things and that's fine, you have to look at the individual characteristics when judging whether something is wrong. It's very interesting that this is starting to change though, as male products become a bigger market for companies.	5
So apparently Russia sent a bunch of bombs on a school in Syria.  It killed like 22 kids.  Now the Russian government is trying to say it never happened.  They even showed satellite images of another place and claimed it was there.  Some organization called HRW (Human Rights Watch) had evidence to show otherwise.  They even had images of the same type of aircraft that the Russians use.	1
Did you hear that some kids in another country are passing out in school because they do not have enough to eat?  The school can not do much or wont due to lack of funding.  Over 35% of kids do not even go to school because of lack of food causing some effect.  That is so sad.  I am glad that our government has different programs instilled to prevent that.	0
So sad! The middle east just keeps getting worse.  I hate what’s happening to these people, but I’m not sure how to solve it.  I wish there was a simple, easy fix.  However, it seems like every time we try to fix something it just gets worse.  It’s such a complex situation with no easy answer.  Unfortunately, I don’t see it being solved any time soon.	0
Wow - I don’t know what I’d do in this situation.  How sad for these people.  They have to leave everything behind, and they really don’t have a lot of options.  I feel really sad for the children.  It’s like they have no home.  What a mess.  I wish the middle east wasn’t so violent.  I don’t understand all the hate.	0
Wow - what a lucky cop!! I can't believe he was able to stop that guy.  The community is much better off without him.  As fascinating as I find true crime, I really don't understand the impulse of some people to kill.  It's crazy.  I can't believe the damage that guy caused. Luckily, he was stopped!!	5
I read an interesting article online about Russia again. Apparently one of Putins former aids had just died outside of a hotel in D.C., that is really crazy and scary. Apparently a lot of people are thinking that this could be foul play and it wouldn't be a surprise since the Russian government is known for doing this sort of thing all the time. He was apparently fixing to cut a deal with the federal government which would have angered the Russian government so I bet they killed him off so that they could avoid him giving away information to the federal government.	2
I read that apparently a man in Georgia was accused of deliberately leaving his son in the car to die from the heat. I really hope he gets the death penalty and they leave him in a hot car just like he did to his son. The world is filled with evil people and it was really disturbing to hear this story.	3
Police officers are getting out of control nowadays. I can't believe that there hasn't been more action taken against this officer who blatantly punched a woman in the face without provocation, especially since the entire incident was caught on tape. It makes no sense to me that this officer hasn't been charged with assault in this case.	3
it is about time that for profit education has had the breaks put on them.  provide a substandard education at the students and government's expense in unconsionable.  they should have been shut down years earlier.  there are so many cheaper and better alternatives to obtaining and education.  i don't feel sorry for them	3
there are too many police shootings.  however, being in the police is not an easy job.  too many people are in a rush to judgement. if cities would be more forthwright and transparent it would help.  why people feel that violence and looting is a valid method of protest is beyond me.  i have great sympathy for the police.	1
it is amazing how little it takes for some people to harm or kill another person.  it seems like there is a breakdown or morals in our society.  we have become more anonimus and disconected from others where we live, in large cities.  with no connections to others some people in our society act out their aggression on others.	0
After reading that the amphibian population and specifically ranavirus might be caused by humans it makes me sad but I can understand the situation. We can often do things with unintended consequences that are not noticeable in the beginning. This appears to be the thought here that maybe we have caused these amphibians to become sick because of carrying the disease in or perhaps genetic mutations. Either way, it is a sad situation that will hopefully be able to be reversed before it is too late but these types of things happen in our society without specific intention. I feel for the little froggies though and hope science can find a way to preserve them and their habitat.	0
This is such a sad story. I blame the owner of the dog. She should not have had her dog off leash. A big dog like that can really scare someone. Not everyone is a dog lover like we are. Poor Macie had to feel the pain because her owner wasn't doing the right thing. Perhaps the fine for having dogs off leash will result in people not taking their dogs off leash when they walk. Take them to a dog park and let them run.	0
Other story similar to the local news about the killing of a woman I know in town. It always makes me think of the children first. It also makes me wonder how a person could commit such atrocities, especially in front of children. The child that called 911 will no doubt mentally live with that phone call for the rest of their life.  Article seem to have been murder, and a middle class home, maybe drug use or robbery gone wrong? What is wrong with the world today? I will certainly hug my children tighter tonight after reading all these articles about murder, grieving children, deaths, worldly disasters and sadness. The world is such an interesting, wonderful yet sad place all at once. I will also say a prayer for those kids and pray and be thankful for mine.	0
I just read a story about a study being done by a new University of Washington that was funded and the satellite data from NASA, that was about the Arctic Polar Bears. It said that the climate change has been affecting the feeding and breeding of these 19 polar bears population. It has been having a negative impact on them. I did not know that a polar bear depends on the sea ice to eat. They can not outrun their prey so the sit at the air holes of the seals and when they go up to get air the bear will capture it to eat. The days that this ice is available to the bears have shortened over the thirty-five-year study to almost seven weeks. The study shows that this is a continuing pattern. I am really worried about the outcome for these bears. It is sad to think they may become extinct.	0
I just read a story about a black man named Terence Crutcher who was shot and killed by a white police officer named Betty Shelby in Tulsa Oklahoma. She was responding to another call when she noticed Terence Crutcher. The camera on her dashboard showed that Terence had his hands up. It was also video tapped by a helicopter. The officer claimed she felt like her life was in danger. Terence was a good man with a good heart. He was a churchgoer and a father of four children. Hundreds of people mourned his passing. If convicted Betty Shelby age 42 could face 4 years in prison for first degree manslaughter.	0
Reading this article makes me feel sad for many reason. I myself have no idea why those countries are always at war and why so many people are loosing their lives. It also makes me sad to imagine myself in a situation where I am constantly in fear of my life. With so many being lost already it makes me sad to think about these things continually happening.	0
I can't even imagine what it would be like to be minding our own business in a club and then having someone come in and shoot you. This must have been terrifying for this person. I certainly hope they did not lose their life and I also hope this is not an incident that leads to further problems in the future.	2
I know that the affordable care act will effect alot of people out there who are already struggling but this is an issue that just sounds wrong to me. First because so many women that I know who have gotten and IUD had complications and second because the issue of women being able to choose to have an abortion is a bitter conversation to me.	3
We should protect our environment from now on. I think a lot of wild animals have been put into danger because of human beings. People have put too much plastics into the oceans and pollute the living society of wild animals. It was danger to them if there is plastic around. I wish people will do a better jobs.	3
I really don't care about the article I just read. It didn't make me feel any sort of emotions, but I'm forced to fill in this box. Is boredom an emotion? I felt that while reading that massive wall of text. Stuff like the economy and businesses isn't anything worth feeling emotion over. It's also not even really worth worrying about when it's not something you can actually do anything about yourself.	1
That article was a steaming pile of nonsense. Storied about criminals emboldened to assault and kill cops by the media's sympathetic bias towards criminals is a regular occurrence these days. Black Lives Matter is a borderline terrorist organization who believes there should be no laws, or at the very least, that black people should be exempt from them. They're in favor of abolishing the police and penal system. What sane person riots over a criminal getting the inevitable ending that comes from leading a lawless and dangerous life? When I read about a white criminal getting killed in a confrontation with the police, I feel relief. My instinct is to say "good riddance" and not go out and loot a liquor store and burn down fast food restaurants.	3
Boring. I don't care, again, because it doesn't impact me or anyone I know directly. These people should move. I sure as hell wouldn't stay there. I do find it hilarious that this is happening in California, where they seem so concerned about every possible social issue under the sun, especially taking care of people who are here illegally, yet there are parts of the state where actual citizens can't drink the water like they're living in a third world nation. Then again, given Commiefornia's stated desire to secede, they might get to live their third world dream.	3
The political divide in this country has only gotten worse over the years. Trump in particular has allow a rather nasty aspect of American society to rise to the surface and be open about their nastiness. This means that people on opposite political spectrum cannot see eye-to-eye at all. This makes compromise even worse and less likely to succeed.	1
An article talking about increasing the deportations of Haitians is one that I feel for those involved. Haiti has been brutalized by mother nature, and the Clintons, and people are trying to get somehwere to survive while the country recovers. The U.S. let's them in to ship them back out and that is a bit ridiculous. It's not a situation where those from Mexico just sneak over and hide from society. These people need help but it doesn't shock me that the U.S. wiould do this in a time of need. Sympathy felt but helpless to do anything about it.	0
So i just read this horrific article about women in nigeria being raped by the officials that rescued them from Boko Haram. If you don't know about Boko Haram you should really look them up. These poor women have no one to trust. I am shocked by what i read and feel so sorry for these people. i wish there was something we could do that would have real impact on their lives. you must read this article.	0
you will not believe the crazy article i just read. Let me tell you about it. The article was about a man who had killed himself after killing his wife and the main thing that was being questioned was "why did he have to die?" What??? I don't understand why they aren't looking into why he killed his wife since they don't know. Its pretty easy to speculate why he killed himself. I just don't even know what to think about this article.	5
A mother pushed a stroller onto an elevator that was not there. The baby dies of injuries and the mother was hurt. The building had over 100 elevator violations but did not stay on top of things to make sure the elevators were working properly. The building neglience caused an infants death. I cant imagine going through something like that, that poor mother.	0
A hiker was lost in a Malaysian jungle for ten days. The hiker only brought enough food for one day. He survived on bananas and berries he found in the jungle. When he was found he was covered in leaches, weak, and very disoriented. Its a miracle he survived on his own for ten days in the jungle. There was no cell coverage in the part of the jungle he was in so he could not communicate to anyone or ask for help.	1
I cannot stand Donald Trump and his fear mongering. Most Muslim people I know are very, very kind people. It is so unfortunate there are so many hate crimes because of the ignorance our President continues to blast on twitter. It's not just Muslims. It's everyone that is not part of the Alt-White movement. Jewish people, LBGTQ people. Black people. It is fueled by hate and ignorance. Trumps Muslim ban did more harm than good! He just caused fear, creating a deeper divide in our country. It's sad.	0
I cannot believe there is someone evil enough in this world to torture a poor, helpless kitten this way. Did you read this article? The kitten was wrapped so tightly, it's little legs were close to it's face. It made me cry. It is horrifying to think people that are capable of this exist. Anyone that does this is a true psychopath. What will they do next? Murder young children? Anyone that is that cruel to animals should be punished. Please share. We have to raise awareness.	3
This story I have read was heart breaking! Two men were shot, one twice in the stomach and the other shot in the back. Sadly no weapons were recovered and no arrests were made causing me to worry the person that did this is free. This upsets me worried for myself and others, hoping to protect the community from the criminal gun man still at large. The two men were taken to the hospital, hoping for a speedy recovery for them and comfort for their families after this tragic incident! The terrible time they must all be going through now. Worrying and stressing over this unthinkable situation. I sure do hope the person responsible is found and arrested quickly, to keep our community safe from additional attacks and to to get him the help he needs. Not to mention time in prison. Certainly right	0
Hello again! Writing to share some things I have been learning about. I read that  Syrians and Iraqis are granted asylum in Germany far more often than Pakistanis, and Nigerians. Germany is confronting the task of deciding who gets to stay. If you’re from Syria or Iraq, sanctuary is almost guaranteed. But if you’re from Nigeria or Pakistan, chances are you journeyed all the way there for nothing. This is so distressing!	0
Hey have you heard about the polar bears? This global warming thing is going to take over there home land so fast. They will not be able to out swim the things that will b more of a chance at getting them because of whats happening right now. We have to help save the polar bears. Its been pretty terrible how the goverment and companoes just dont care to help save these animals.	2
The article that I read was about these architects that are building things and they are kindof looking at the tactics for buildings and their tools that are used to build the buildings.  They want to see what will be safer and allow the people to make better buildings.  There was a recent mishap that caused several people to die and it was related to the building issues.	1
The person in the article was participating in a fund raising event and the event was about getting pies thrown into the faces by people.  I guess that things got a little bit rough because the guy that was getting the pie in the face got injured somehow.  It was pretty bad and he had to seek out the medical help for the injuries to his face.	0
There was a person in the articles that was muslim and at a bar for nightly events.  They got into a dispute with another person and then the other person killed them.  The investigators said something about donald trump and his hatred toward muslim people maybe having something to do with making the murderer feel justified in his actions.	0
The Islamic state is now desperately using human shields to try and deter our attacks against them. This is a strategy that is doomed to failure for multiple reasons, the biggest being the civilians they are using aren't going to tolerate that shit forever, and will probably start resisting and escaping. The next biggest, America doesn't really show restraint when they want to bomb a target and civilians are present. I mean, we generally go out of our way to not blow up the nearby children's hospital, but the second we suspect Bin Laden's cousin is in there 7000 drones start swarming.	1
I think the short of it really is that the racists won the election. It is incredibly sad that such a seemingly easy to win election against someone who is openly calling groups of racist things, and actually encouraging hate and chaos, was lost. The democrats are right to be taking a long look at how they do things, they've always been the party that is "we're like the republicans, but you won't gag as much voting for us." I think the average person who cares about politics, and is liberal, got a shocking wake up call this time around, and we're going to see people turn out in incredible numbers to vote.	0
I think the process of dying can contain various levels of trauma.  Some people die with less pain, and we tend to call them lucky.  I tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological pain over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying.  One type of emotion I can partly relate to is the idea that the party (life) keeps going on, but you have to leave.  The idea of no longer consuming new information or experiences.  The process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me, but thinking about being dead does not inflict many emotions on me.  I feel neutral or calm about the idea, and I see no rational reason for worrying about it.	1
It's always sad to hear someone losing their lives, especially during a terrible crash such as Yu Xu, who was the first woman to fly a Chinese fighter jet. It's even worse that it happened during a training mission, and not a real mission. I hope her family can find peace and that she can be remembered for her positivity and caring towards others.	0
Hey, I wonder if this crash is related to terrorism. I bet it was. Seems like big accidents nowadays has something to do with terrorism. You got any family from Delaware? I don't. There is one thing I know, that I don't want to die in a vehicle accident. That has to be terrible. I guess if it's instant death then it's okay. I just don't want to suffer for a long time. I hope the people taken to the hospital are okay.	2
Man, car crashes happen all the time. There is no way they can be prevented. I would like to think that the smart cars of the future would help prevent this, but I am not to sure. Somebody could probably hack those and cause massive car wrecks as well. People should also drive safer as well. There is definitely too much speeding. I wonder if drunk driving was the cause of the wreck. That's a huge problem that causes a bunch of wrecks. Don't drink and drive people.	3
This article was about the disturbing finds by the Iraqi military as they re-captured territory from retreating Islamic State fighters. They found mass graves of people killed by ISIS and although there is some confusion about the details, there are dozens or maybe over 100 bodies. There is also evidence of torture. The ISIS fighters were certainly brutal towards their victims, and have captured many more to use as human shields or to kill outright for their perceived beliefs.	1
The article I read was about the disparity in responsibility for birth control between men and women. A new male birth control was rejected as having too many side effects on men, when options available to women have far more and more severe side effects. The article mentioned that birth control for women revolutionized lives so much that the side effects were deemed acceptable, but men are not accustomed to ceding convenience for responsibility, are used to women taking control in this area.	1
From this article I learned about repression of gay rights in Uganda. Gay rights protesters were rounded up by police and taken away from the resort where they were protesting and of those that attempted to resume protesting at another spot, police escorted them away. Gay rights have been struggling in Uganda, where homosexuality is illegal and repressed.	3
I was reading an article about poachers killing off many elephants because of the ivory trade. One part that stuck in my mind is that in one country, the elephants are protected more than they are in the neighboring country. It is odd that an elephant can literally walk away from its protection by wandering into the neighboring country. I was not aware of any of this. The article somewhat jokingly said that elephants do not have passports.	0
Hey look at what I have been reading into. I want your opinions on this matter at hand. So civilian casualties are starting to rise as Iraqi forces push into Mosul. The vehicles screeched into the small field hospital on the outskirts of Mosul carrying desperate loads: soldiers injured in battle as well as men, women and children caught in the crossfire of Iraq’s war against the Islamic State. Now you know me. I would be in terrible trouble this is not a way of life. Why are were even in war. Why harm our children. This has saddened me to no end. We do not need, want or find any peace in war!	0
Interesting article, and I can see both sides of the issue.  On one hand, it is true that it's incredibly, incredibly hard for people to immigrate to America.  The old saying that you "need money to make money" is true in the sense that if you show up on our shores with nothing at all, it's going to be awfully hard to make anything of yourself.  That being said, the American dream has always been one of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps and being a self-made-man.  You need to be able to do things on your own and most of the most successful people on Earth came from abject poverty.	1
This sort of story is showing up far too much in the news anymore.  It shows a deepening divide of racial tensions in America, which is something I thought we had finally put behind us.  That being said, I mean that the racial tension is coming from BOTH sides, not just one side or the other.  BOTH sides need to be held accountable for their actions and the divide they are creating in this country.	2
Wow, what an amazing story.  I had no idea that the zika virus could cause such horrific developmental problems in children.  As a parent of 2 myself, nothing scares me more than to think about all the horrible things that could happen to my kids in this world, and what I would do to prevent them from having to endure such things.  What a terrible disease, and one that we know so little about and have essentially no real medicine type treatment for!  I'm sure it's only a matter of time before this makes it's way closer to where I live!  Scary!	2
Here's one more great reason to never allow Sharia law into the US in any way, shape, or form.  This is commonplace in the Arab world, where women are treated essentially as slaves or worse, while men can do anything they want and get away with it.  What a terrible sense of "justice" or "law".  This poor women would've, at best, been scarred for the rest of her life just on the grounds of being raped by multiple men.  I can only imagine how traumatic this is for her when she's thrown in jail after being the victim of a horrible crime!  Disgusting!	4
Those native people really dont deserve that kind of treatment its unfair. how can you have people just not speak their own native language? i dont get why they cant just let them live in both worlds and experience both cultures instead of forcing them to be a part of their specific culture. They really need to be spoken up against for this kind of injustice	3
So tragic and sad that this police officer was just doing his job and now he's gone and his family is left to grieve his loss. I hope they figure out who did this and serve justice to the fullest extent.  It sounds like it could be one of the people they found dead, though.  I guess we'll find out later.	0
Okay, I live by the Arkansas River so I  know about snapping turtles.  All this guy had to do is move to another spot and the turtle was not going to chase him down.  I'm sure the guy must have been near a nest or something if the turtle tried to attack.  Still, should he be charged with a felony?  My Granny Jones used to make turtle soup out of the snappers they fished out of her creek.  I guess the difference is he wasn't killing the turtle for food...But, a felony?	5
These poor people.  I hope the researchers can find a way to help them.  The thought that you can't even use the water that is deep in the ground due to arsenic contamination is horrible.  This is a sign of the times, however, and I believe as populations grow, water is going to be a big commodity due to the scarcity of clean water.	0
I hear the British Government is looking to drill for oil again. This time they are looking to drill near the Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda. Everyone is so dependent on oil all the time. Too bad for some giraffes that live there as they will be displaced. Of course I could really care less about giraffes 5000 miles away from me. Still I wish the giraffes the best I suppose. Brits are such weasels it figures they would look to kill a bunch of giraffes for their own selfish gains. Governments all stink.	3
It's always sad when you lose the legends no matter what. For one it makes you feel old but for two you lose any future of their work. It is also sad for the family who loses a loved one and is hard to imagine the responsibility of keeping up the name of the famous person they've loss. I mean how do you know what they would do with the rights of their music or if you should even use them anymore?	0
I feel bad for the Queen.  She just lost her husband and now she's sick. I also feel bad for the people over there.  They've had rulers as leaders for so long that most of the weren't even alive to experience anybody else.  I hope she recovers and is able to get a few more good years out of her life.	0
I just read an article about cave divers in Florida who died trying to explore the cave system.  It seems like an incredibly dangerous thing to do.  I'm not so sure I see the benefit in doing this kind of activity.  I feel like they people knew the risks and what could happen if things go wrong.  This is not something I'd do myself.	1
I was reading an article about the Zika virus.  It was a fairly comprehensive article that went over what the virus was and how it affects humans.  It's scary how it can be transmitted through sexual intercourse.  I still don't think I have any serious chance of contracting the virus fortunately.  Those that have are going to have a hard time in life.	0
I think most people would be disturbed about how animals are treated before they are slaughtered and used for meat.  I feel like aside from clearly inhumane treatment, it should be expected that killing an animal for food isn't exactly going to be the most pleasant process for the creature.  I'm not particularly surprised that the method of stunning chickens has a failure rate.	4
I just read a really sad story about a kid who got lost while hiking in Vietnam. You should read it. It's frustrating because he made a number of very basic errors that even the young kids in my scouting group know to avoid. He was alone. He lacked proper gear to survive changes in weather. He did not know his route. When he got lost, he kept moving instead of staying put. He also failed to let rescuers come to him.  He could very easily have been stayed if he had made all of these error s and just stayed put. I hope his friend doesn't feel too much guilt over this. It's not her fault but judging from the article, she blames herself. I can't imagine what his parents are going through. My mom is always worried when I go backpacking and she'd go crazy if anything like this happened to me.	0
I don't know if you've seen this article about the war on cops, but I found it pretty unconvincing. It actually made me a bit angry, because it focuses on police deaths form two years ago and doesn't take into account current figures. Also, by focusing on deaths alone, it completely glosses over injuries to paint a picture that policing is safe in the current climate. It feels a lot like fake news to me. All you have to do is pick up the paper to see how often cops are involved in fights with criminals and crazy people.	3
This story is just sad and I just feel like there should be something that we can do to prevent killings of wild animals just because they own the earth as well as we do. Just because humans are expanding and advancing in technology it does not mean that we kill and we hunt everything that we see. It is heartbreaking.	0
The people who will lose homes because of this should be fully compensated and be fully relocated with full government assistance and be transfered to a different location that is still nearby their old homes that will be razed. It's just not fair if they will be leaving these people homeless and will probably have a hard time coping with the loss of their house if this plan gets approved.	1
what horror this news. in poor little boy of just 2 years of age he fell through the window of his apartment on the 11th floor of a building. The mother relates that I go to sleep with her older brother and this one hour later I climb to the window that apparently was open and rushed into the void crashing with the asphalt of the parking lot. A neighbor found the scene and desperate for horror called 911.	2
Women in Iceland protested the pay gap between men and women by arguing that a woman's salary is 30% less than the salary of a man in similar work positions, the women of Iceland decreased their working day 30% of the time daily work and went out to protest united to a square.This was supported by the majority of the community.	1
This area has been devastated by natural disasters and it appears to only be getting worse. I can't believe the amount of disasters that appear to be concentrated in one place, and the resilience that the citizens have shown to survive. I also can't believe the looting and break-ins that have been reported in the area, what kind of people steal from those in need?	5
I am so tired of hearing about this stuff, it's so fake. Trump is just a fake conservative, the same way that all of the liberals are fake liberals.

You know one thing late Thursday that the Islamic State used a rocket containing mustard gas against U.S. troops in Iraq. The general was addressing leaked news reports that investigators had found a black oily substance on a rocket that landed near the perimeter of the base.

There are several strange factors surrounding the tragic and fatal event. First, why was there not a sign or caution tape to block off the broken elevator? How was the mother able to walk into it without knowing that it was broken? The other tenant's reports about the condition of the elevators in the past are also alarming. Why was this problem not addressed long ago by the landlord? It should not take such a horrible event to occur for people to recognize that there is a problem with the building and the way technicians are doing inspections.	5
This is just disgusting. I cannot believe that this is happening to people. Why are people afraid to go to the doctor? there is no reason for this. I am numb to all this madness and I cannot believe I am writing about a man's penis right now. I cannot find any excuse for this and people need to be educated about the healthcare system so they are not so afraid of it.	4
